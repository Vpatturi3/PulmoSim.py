They are often treated by parenteral administra- tions of antimicrobials. Unfortunately, systemic therapies of high-dose antimicrobials can lead to severe adverse effects and this calls for a need to develop inhaled formulations that enable targeted drug delivery to the airways with minimal systemic drug exposure. Recent technological advances facilitate the development of inhaled anti-microbial therapies. The newer mesh nebulisers have achieved minimal drug residue, higher aerosolisation ef\ufb01ciencies and rapid administration compared to traditional jet nebulisers. Novel particle engineering and intelligent device design also make dry powder inhalers appealing for the delivery of high-dose antibiotics.

Introduction Lower respiratory infections are particularly problematic [1], being the top leading cause of death in the developing countries and the third leading cause of death world-wide [2]. Apart from the high mortality and morbidity rates, respiratory infections are also causing an escalating \ufb01nancial burden to the global healthcare system. In general, respiratory infections are dif\ufb01cult to treat because microbes reside deep in the airways where only a small proportion of drug can ac- cess after traditional oral or parenteral administration. Consequently, high doses of drugs are required to maintain drug levels above their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) at the infection sites [3]. It has been re- ported that less than 4% of colistin methanesulfonate, an inactive prodrug of colistin, was converted to its active form after intravenous administra- tion [4]. To achieve colistin concentrations above its MIC at the site of in- fection in airways, high doses of colistin methanesulfonate would have to be administered parenterally to patients. Unfortunately, s", "tive form after intravenous administra- tion [4]. To achieve colistin concentrations above its MIC at the site of in- fection in airways, high doses of colistin methanesulfonate would have to be administered parenterally to patients. Unfortunately, systemic expo- sure of high dose colistin can cause severe neurotoxicity and nephrotoxi- city in up to 60% of treated patients [5]. Delivery of antibiotics directly to the respiratory tract provides an attractive solution in such situations be- cause it allows higher drug concentrations to be achieved at the target site with lower systemic exposures [6]. A pharmacokinetic study involv- ing the nebulisation of colistin methanesulfonate solution (2 million IU) in cystic \ufb01brosis patients clearly demonstrated that high drug concentra- tions could be achieved in the sputum (Cmax 6 mg/l) and maintained above MIC90 for a prolonged period (e.g. 12 h) with negligible systemic drug exposure (Cmax b0.3 mg/l) [7]. In this review, innovative formulation strategies of inhaled drug ther- apies for the treatment of respiratory infections are discussed. As devices for inhaled formulations have been reviewed previously [8] and clinical indications of inhaled anti-microbials are discussed in another article of this issue [9], they are only brie\ufb02y described here wherein it is relevant to the formulation design. 2. Inhaled anti-bacterial formulations To date, only tobramycin and aztreonam solutions have been approved for nebulisation in USA. Nebulised colistin methanesulfonate solution (also known as colistimethate sodium, CMS) has been approved only in some European countries. Other nebulised antibiotics include amikacin, cipro\ufb02oxacin and levo\ufb02oxacin, all of which are under- going clinical trials. For dry powder formulations, only tobramycin (TO", "colistimethate sodium, CMS) has been approved only in some European countries. Other nebulised antibiotics include amikacin, cipro\ufb02oxacin and levo\ufb02oxacin, all of which are under- going clinical trials. For dry powder formulations, only tobramycin (TOBI\u00ae podhaler\u00ae) and colistin methanesulfonate (Colobreathe\u00ae) have been approved in USA and Europe, respectively. Dry powder formulations of cipro\ufb02oxacin and vancomycin are in the advanced development stage [10]. Most inhaled antibiotic products focus on the treatment of chronic respiratory infections such as those in cystic \ufb01brosis (CF) patients, an autosomal recessive multi-system condition characterized by recurrent respiratory infections [11]. Clinical in vivo data have shown that inhaled antibiotics can decrease the colonisation of Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and delay the onset of infections [12]. Conse- quently, improved lung function and quality of life can be achieved along with reduced morbidities and hospital admissions. Nebulised antibiotics can also be used for non-CF bronchiectasis although no product has yet been approved for this indication. Compared to CF patients, the nebulisation of antibiotics may cause more severe local irritation, including bronchospasm, coughing and wheezing in patients with non-CF bronchiectasis. Pre-treatment with bronchodilators or encapsulation of drugs in liposomes may reduce the occurrences or severity of these adverse events [10]. 2.1. Wet aerosol formulations Nebulisation of antibiotic solutions or suspensions is commonly employed for the treatment of respiratory infections in both adult and children [9,13]. During nebulisation, antibiotic liquid aerosols are generated by mechanical or electrical mechanisms. Recent advances in nebuliser design have been ", "s is commonly employed for the treatment of respiratory infections in both adult and children [9,13]. During nebulisation, antibiotic liquid aerosols are generated by mechanical or electrical mechanisms. Recent advances in nebuliser design have been reviewed elsewhere [9]. Brie\ufb02y, convention- al jet nebulisers are bulky and generally have low drug delivery ef\ufb01cien- cies [14], whilst vibrating mesh nebulisers exhibit minimal residual volume, rapid output and improved drug delivery ef\ufb01ciencies despite its higher purchase price. Other emerging technologies for nebulisation include surface acoustic wave micro\ufb02uidic atomisation, which was shown to have a high delivery ef\ufb01ciency, with FPF ranging from 70\u201380% [15]. This new technology causes minimal damage to shear- sensitive biomolecules of plasmid DNA and antibodies [16], thus solving the problem of drug loss during high shear nebulisation. Today, drug delivery by nebulisation can also be optimised by digital software control and performance feedback systems. For example, the nebulisation of a solution of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid in saline using the I-neb nebuliser equipped with the Adaptive Aerosol Delivery system resulted in a reasonably high FPF emitted (b4.6 \u03bcm) of 56.8% [17]. 2.2. Dry powder formulations Dry powder inhaler (DPI) devices are generally small and portable. The duration of treatment for DPIs is also short [18\u201320] and this results in improved patient compliance [21]. Dry powder mixtures of drugs and/or excipients may also be chemically more stable and less suscepti- ble to microbial contamination than corresponding liquid formulations 84 Q.(T.) Zhou et al. / Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 85 (2015) 83\u201399", "ess suscepti- ble to microbial contamination than corresponding liquid formulations 84 Q.(T.) Zhou et al. / Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 85 (2015) 83\u201399", "[22\u201324]. These advantages contribute to the superior treatment ef\ufb01- ciencies and patient adherence of DPIs as exempli\ufb01ed by the colistin methanesulfonate and tobramycin DPIs [19]. However, some powder formulations may be physically unstable at under conditions of high hu- midity, which is discussed in Section 2.2.2. 2.2.1. Powder production and particle engineering Drug particles with aerodynamic diameters ranging from 1\u20135 \u03bcm are optimal for lung deposition. To obtain \ufb01ne drug powders in this size range, jet milling is traditionally adopted by the pharmaceutical indus- try. However, jet-milled powder is notoriously cohesive because of the high surface energies of the milled particles [25]. For low-dose drugs used for the treatment of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary dis- ease, coarse carrier particles are often added to improve powder \ufb02ow. However, this approach is unfavourable for high-dose antibiotics as ad- ditional excipients will increase powder volume which may necessitate an excessive number of inhalation manoeuvres or makes the multi-dose inhaler bulky. Therefore, particle engineering becomes an attractive so- lution for the production of carrier-free (or with minimum carrier) inhalable powders of antibiotics with good \ufb02owability and superior aerosolisation properties [26]. Spray drying is a prime example of a particle engineering technique suitable for the ef\ufb01cient production of inhalable particles with scale-up capability. It has been used for the manufacturing of inhaled insulin (Exubera\u00ae, P\ufb01zer), tobramycin (TOBI\u00ae podhaler\u00ae, Novartis) and man- nitol (Aridol\u00ae, Pharmaxis). Leucine is a recognised dispersibility enhancer that is commonly added into spray-drying feed solution or suspension [27,28]. Weaker particulate interactions are achieved with low sur", "n (TOBI\u00ae podhaler\u00ae, Novartis) and man- nitol (Aridol\u00ae, Pharmaxis). Leucine is a recognised dispersibility enhancer that is commonly added into spray-drying feed solution or suspension [27,28]. Weaker particulate interactions are achieved with low surface-energy leucine forming a rough shell or coating on the outer surface of spray-dried par- ticles [29\u201331]. Porous particles of tobramycin and cipro\ufb02oxacin pro- duced by spray drying emulsion formulations of these drugs via the PulmoSphere\u2122technology have demonstrated satisfactory \ufb02ow and aerosolisation performance [32\u201334]. The PulmoSphere\u2122technology in- volves the preparation of stable emulsions of per\ufb02uorooctyl bromide (Per\ufb02ubron) in water containing a pre-dissolved drug by high- pressure homogenisation, followed by spray drying the emulsion. Aerosolisation performances of PulmoSphere\u2122tobramycin formula- tions were consistent at different temperatures (10\u201340 \u00b0C), relative hu- midities (10\u201365%) and air\ufb02ow rates (40\u201385 l/min) [35]. Such high aerosolisation ef\ufb01ciencies translate to consistent drug deposition pat- terns in patients with varying inhalation abilities [36]. Additionally, the good powder \ufb02owability of the spherical and porous spray-dried particles reduced the need for carriers to aid manufacturing and dispersion. Hollow particles of capreomycin (a second-line anti-tuberculosis drug) with corrugated surfaces have been produced by spray drying a feed containing 80% capreomycin and 20% leucine in a co-solvent of ethanol and water (1:1) [37]. The powder formulation was stable at 4 \u00b0C for three months, but physically and chemically unstable after one month of storage under accelerated conditions of 40 \u00b0C and 75% relative humidity. This was attributed to the absorption of signi\ufb01cant amounts of water during storage [37", "table at 4 \u00b0C for three months, but physically and chemically unstable after one month of storage under accelerated conditions of 40 \u00b0C and 75% relative humidity. This was attributed to the absorption of signi\ufb01cant amounts of water during storage [37]. In a Phase I clinical study, administration of the highest dose (300 mg) of inhaled capreomycin was found to provide a serum concentration of drug above MIC against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (2 mg/l) for only a short period of approxi- mately 2 h, with a T1/2 of 4.8 h [38]. In this study, drug concentration in local airways or in sputum was not measured. Inhaled therapy might generate a high concentration of capreomycin in respiratory tracts although systemic drug concentration was low, which deserves further investigation. Stable, inhalable porous para-aminosalicylic acid particles have also been produced by spray drying with 1,2- dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine in ethanol [39] or with ammonium carbonate [40]. Re-crystallisation enables the production of inhalable crystalline drug powders that are otherwise unstable in their amorphous forms after spray drying or milling. McConville and Son developed a novel dry powder formulation of rifampicin by recrystallising the drug into a \ufb02ake-like crystal hydrate using anhydrous ethanol [41]. This formula- tion was chemically stable for up to nine months under ambient condi- tions, unlike amorphous rifampicin which underwent approximately 26% degradation during storage. Chan et al. also developed inhalable, elongated crystals of rifapentine, a long-acting derivative of rifampicin [42]. The crystalline particles exhibited a high FPF of 83.2% determined via the Aerolizer\u00ae device at a \ufb02ow rate of 100 l/min, and were also chemically more stable than its amorphous counterpart ", "of rifapentine, a long-acting derivative of rifampicin [42]. The crystalline particles exhibited a high FPF of 83.2% determined via the Aerolizer\u00ae device at a \ufb02ow rate of 100 l/min, and were also chemically more stable than its amorphous counterpart [42]. Surface coating of cohesive \ufb01ne particles with force control agents (e.g. magnesium stearate or sodium stearate) can potentially improve powder \ufb02owability and aerosolisation [43,44]. Magnesium stearate has been approved for inhalation by FDA (Foradil\u00ae Certihaler\u00ae, BREO\u00ae ELLIPTA\u2122and ANORO\u2122ELLIPTA\u2122) and UK (Pulmicort\u00ae CFC- free Inhaler). Qualitative and quantitative data from surface chemistry measurements have demonstrated that the deposition of an ultra-thin coating layer (in the nanometer-scale) of magnesium stearate on jet- milled drug powders by mechanical dry coating can bring a substantial reduction in their cohesiveness [43\u201346]. Tobramycin powders coated with 1% w/w of sodium stearate via spray drying also achieved a high FPF total (particles b5 \u03bcm over the recovered dose) of 84.3 \u00b1 2.0% compared to 27.1 \u00b1 1.9% for pure spray-dried tobramycin, measured via the Aerolizer\u00ae device at a \ufb02ow rate of 60 l/min [47]. It is noteworthy that the choice of excipient is critical to the aerosolisation performance of coated powders. Belotti et al. showed that the addition of PEG-32 stearate, a surface-active excipient, decreased the FPD of spray-dried amikacin powder [48]. Advanced particle engineering techniques and intelligent device designs have contributed to much improved DPI therapies of antibiotics. However, adverse events of cough and throat irritation are common for inhaled therapy of high-dose antibiotics in either wet or dry form. There is a long-term argument on whether wet form is more tolerable by the patients; ho", "herapies of antibiotics. However, adverse events of cough and throat irritation are common for inhaled therapy of high-dose antibiotics in either wet or dry form. There is a long-term argument on whether wet form is more tolerable by the patients; however, to date there is no suf\ufb01cient data from well-designed clinical studies to conclude. On the other hand, the nature of drug plays a more important role in the severity of local side effects. This topic has been discussed in detail in other articles of this issue [9,49]. 2.2.2. Stability of spray-dried powders Amorphous or partly amorphous forms of many small molecule drugs produced in the spray drying process may be unstable [50\u201352]. Thereby one of concerns on spray-dried drug powders pertains to their physical and chemical instabilities, particularly for the reservoir- type inhalers. In an early study, Adi et al. reported that spray-dried cip- ro\ufb02oxacin powders were amorphous and absorbed signi\ufb01cant amounts of water of up to 7.9% w/w when exposed to a relative humidity of 50% [53]. Re-crystallisation occurred at a higher relative humidity of 70%, demonstrating moisture-induced instability. Co-spray-dried combina- tion powders of cipro\ufb02oxacin with 50% w/w mannitol reduced drug hygroscopicity and prevented the re-crystallisation of amorphous cipro\ufb02oxacin [53]. However, the \ufb02ip side of this is that the addition of 50% excipients would signi\ufb01cantly increase the total amount of powder required for inhalation and thus may impact convenience. Recently, Zhou et al. produced carrier-free colistin powders (a polypeptide) by spray drying. The powders exhibited high FPF total (b5 \u03bcm over the recovered dose) values of N80%, determined via the Aerolizer\u00ae at a \ufb02ow rate of 100 l/min [54].

The powders exhibited high FPF total (b5 \u03bcm over the recovered dose) values of N80%, determined via the Aerolizer\u00ae at a \ufb02ow rate of 100 l/min [54]. The superior aerosolisation performance of the spray-dried colistin powders is attributed to their rough particle surfaces (Fig. 1a) and low surface energies [55]. It is noted that unlike many small molecule drugs that may re-crystallise during storage, the spray-dried amorphous colistin powders remained stable under ambient conditions, indicating that spray drying was suit- able for the production of stable, inhalable colistin powder. It was also found that both the supplied and spray-dried colistin powders absorbed up to 30% water when exposed to an elevated relative humidity of 90%. Airtight packaging for each individual dose is highly recommended to 85 Q.(T.) Zhou et al. / Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 85 (2015) 83\u201399", "avoid moisture induced instability [54]. In a subsequent study, by coat- ing the hygroscopic colistin particle surfaces with hydrophobic rifampi- cin, moisture-induced deterioration in aerosolisation performance of colistin could be circumvented [56]. Interestingly, data obtained from time-of-\ufb02ight secondary ion mass spectrometry and X-ray photoelec- tron spectroscopy showed that the surfaces of the composite drug par- ticles were dominated by hydrophobic rifampicin although equivalent ratios of two drugs were used [56]. 2.3. Liposomal formulations Many inhaled antibiotics are water-soluble and can be absorbed readily into the systemic circulation, which are consequently cleared. To maintain drug concentrations above their MICs in the respiratory tract, liposomal formulations of inhaled drugs are exploited to sustain drug release, prolong the action of drug in the infection sites and en- hance bacterial killing. Sustained-release of antibiotics reduces dosing frequency and improves patient compliance. In addition, liposomal for- mulations could potentially enable targeted delivery of antibiotics [57]. When delivered to the respiratory tract, liposomes are engulfed and de- graded by the macrophages with subsequent release of the antibiotics within them [58] and this mechanism can be exploited to target intra- cellular infections [59]. Modi\ufb01cation of liposomes with mannose could facilitate active targeting of macrophages with mannose receptors [60, 61]. Some liposomal formulations have been shown tolerated by inhala- tion and have a good safety pro\ufb01le, which has been discussed in a recent review of the topic [62]. Table 1 summarises the key studies on inhaled liposomal formulations of anti-microbials. 2.3.1.

Table 1 summarises the key studies on inhaled liposomal formulations of anti-microbials. 2.3.1. Amikacin Arikace\u00ae is an inhaled liposomal formulation of amikacin, comprising the drug encapsulated in neutral liposomes composed of dipalmitoyl- phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol. In a Phase II clinical trial, Arikace\u00ae (280 mg or 560 mg) was nebulised once-daily to cystic \ufb01brosis patients infected by P. aeruginosa for 28 days using the eFlow\u00ae nebuliser [63]. The outcomes of the study con\ufb01rmed the acute tolerability, safety, biolog- ical activity and ef\ufb01cacy of the inhaled therapy. Using the same nebuliser, Li et al. reported a 30\u201335% loss of entrapped amikacin with a FPF of 32.5% upon nebulisation of Arikace\u00ae [64]. The loss of encapsulated drug from liposomes deserves further investigations with other nebuliser devices in order to understand the role of nebuliser on the performance of liposo- mal formulations. 2.3.2. Cipro\ufb02oxacin Liposomal formulations enable sustained-release of cipro\ufb02oxacin [65,66] leading to reduced dosing frequencies and improved treatment convenience [67]. Clinical data have shown that a nebulised liposomal formulation of cipro\ufb02oxacin (Lipoquin\u2122) [68] and a combination of liposomal and free cipro\ufb02oxacin (Pulmaquin\u2122) [67] were both ef\ufb01ca- cious with well-accepted tolerability in CF and non-CF bronchitis pa- tients. In vitro characterization of these liposomal cipro\ufb02oxacin formulations has demonstrated liposome integrity following jet nebuliza- tion as measured by drug encapsulation, mean vesicle size distribution [69], and in vitro release pro\ufb01le [70]. The addition of surfactant (0.4% polysorbate 20) to these formulations resulted in a faster in vitro release rate", "y following jet nebuliza- tion as measured by drug encapsulation, mean vesicle size distribution [69], and in vitro release pro\ufb01le [70]. The addition of surfactant (0.4% polysorbate 20) to these formulations resulted in a faster in vitro release rate [66,71]. In contrast, other conventional liposomal preparations may have signi\ufb01cantly larger loss of drug encapsulation [64,72]. Additionally, the physicochemical properties of the liposomal formulations remained unchanged after storage at 2\u20138 \u00b0C for up to two years [71]. A facile method was developed to produce inhaled liposomal formu- lations of cipro\ufb02oxacin by dispersing a powder mixture of micronised drug and excipients in saline [73,74]. Upon dispersed, over 90% of drug was encapsulated in the liposomes for the optimised formulations but the encapsulation was reduced to approximately 50 to 55% after nebulisation [73]. Such micronised powder exhibited relatively high FPF of N50% when it was aerosolised by a deagglomeration rig at Fig. 1.

The encapsulation ef\ufb01ciency of aerosolised powder was approximately 35% for cipro\ufb02oxacin [75]. In a subsequent study, the encapsulation ef\ufb01ciency of reconstituted formulation was improved to 93.5% in isotonic saline, 80% in bovine mucin, 75% in porcine mucus and 73% in \ufb01ve-fold-diluted ex vivo human cystic \ufb01brosis patient sputum [76]. In addition to sustained-drug release, liposomal cipro\ufb02oxacin has also demonstrated enhanced anti-microbial activity [77]. Gubernator et al. reported that cationic liposomal cipro\ufb02oxacin formulations possessed 2\u20134 times lower MICs against most reference and clinical strains of P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, including a two-fold decrease in MIC against resistant strains of P. aeruginosa [78]. Enhanced anti-microbial effects of the cationic liposo- mal formulation were attributed to the interaction of positively-charged liposomes with the negatively-charged bacterial cell membrane [79]. Consequently, antibiotics in the liposomes accumulated in the periplasm, leading to more anti-microbial molecules diffusing into the cytoplasm [78,79]. 2.3.3. Polymyxins Desai and co-workers have produced liposomal formulations of polymyxin B by a thin-\ufb01lm hydration technique, with dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol and surfactants of Tween 80 and Span 20 [80]. The optimised formulation achieved an exceptionally high encapsula- tion ef\ufb01ciency of 100% even after nebulisation. However, it is interesting to note the liposomal formulation had a much higher MIC (31.3 \u03bcg/l) against P. aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) than pure polymyxin B (3.9\u2013 7.8 \u03bcg/l) [80]. The possible reason for the reduced antimicrobial activity could be the negative particle surface charge of the liposomes. The consensus bactericidal mechanism of polymyxins is that", " aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) than pure polymyxin B (3.9\u2013 7.8 \u03bcg/l) [80]. The possible reason for the reduced antimicrobial activity could be the negative particle surface charge of the liposomes. The consensus bactericidal mechanism of polymyxins is that: positively charged drug molecules bind to negatively charged lipopolysaccharide of bacterial outer membrane and cause the rupture of bacterial cells [81]. The binding to the lipopolysaccharide could be compromised for negatively charged liposomes, leading to reduced antimicrobial activity. Further investigations are warranted to understand this issue by comparing positively and negatively charged liposomes. Using a dry \ufb01lm method, Wallace et al. encapsulated colistin sulphate and colistin methanesulfonate in dioleoylphosphatidylcholine liposomes of approximately 180 nm in size and achieved encapsulation ef\ufb01ciencies of around 50% [82]. Contrary to expectations, the release of colistin from the liposomes was rapid, with 50% of colistin dissolved in 10 min and no further release was observed in 72 h. These \ufb01ndings differed from the sustained-release pro\ufb01les of colistin liposomes reported by Wang et al. [83]. Wallace hypothesised that unlike typical hydrophilic drugs, amphipathic colistin may have increased the permeability of the liposomal bilayer, enabling more rapid release of encapsulated colistin from the core of the liposomes. In a subsequent study, incorporating colistin in liposomes of azithromycin also enhanced the in vitro release of azithromycin and this was attributed to the increased permeability of liposomes by colistin [84]. This study opens up new research opportunities in the application of liposomal formulations for the delivery of combination antibiotics to the lungs. 2.3.4. Proliposomes for anti-tuberculosi", "o the increased permeability of liposomes by colistin [84]. This study opens up new research opportunities in the application of liposomal formulations for the delivery of combination antibiotics to the lungs. 2.3.4. Proliposomes for anti-tuberculosis agents Proliposomes are dry powders which can form liposomes upon contact with water either before or after administration into the body [85,86]. Rojanarat et al. developed spray-dried proliposomes of isoniazid [87]. Data showed the proliposomes possessed a low FPF of 15\u201335% (b4.4 \u03bcm) due to particle agglomeration [87]. A recent study showed that soya phosphatidylcholine proliposomes of rifapentine produced using single-step spray drying, possessed mass median aerodynamic diameters of 1.56 \u00b1 0.16 \u03bcm and exhibited surprisingly good aerosolisation performance with FPF of 92.5 \u00b1 1.5% measured via a low-ef\ufb01ciency Rotahaler device at 60 l/min [88]. Hence, the choice of proliposome materials affects not just the drug release pro\ufb01le but also aerosolisation performance. Table 1 Summary of key liposomal formulations of inhaled antibiotics.

Zhou et al. / Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 85 (2015) 83\u201399", "One critical challenge in the assessment of inhaled sustained-release formulations pertains to the selection of an appropriate in vitro dissolution method. To date, there is neither regulatory guidelines on the dissolution testing of inhaled products nor any conclusive answers to what constitutes the best dissolution medium capable of mimicking the pulmonary environment [89]. This creates a barrier for quick prediction of formulation performance and development of generic liposomal products. In May of 2014, FDA has called research grant applications to evaluate different in vitro release assays in terms of their capacity in detecting formulation differences and predicting in vivo release of liposomal drug products. Recently, Cipolla developed a dissolution method to evaluate the in vitro dissolution of inhaled liposomal cipro\ufb02oxacin formulations in the lungs [90]. Bovine serum was selected as the release agent that would trigger the release of drug from the liposomes. The method was robust over a range of release parameters including release agent, liposomal concentration, incuba- tion temperature, and buffer pH [90]. An in vitro air-interface Calu-3 cell model was also developed by Ong et al. to evaluate drug release and intracellular drug transport of liposomal cipro\ufb02oxacin formulations on the human epithelium cell lines [91]. Other challenges for the evalu- ation of liposomal formulations include damage of liposome integrity upon nebulisation [92] and differentiation of released and encapsulated drug in vivo. Further fundamental studies are warranted to understand the drug delivery and therapeutic actions of liposomal formulations. 2.4.

Polymeric formulations Investigations into polymeric formulations of antibiotics for inhala- tion have been conducted to address the rapid-release characteristics of many water-soluble antibiotics. Although polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) have been examined as polymeric sustained-release agents in many studies in view of their biocompatibilities and minimal toxicities in in vitro and in vivo studies [93\u201395], the long-term persistence of these undissolved particles in the lungs remains a concern as they may trigger pulmonary in\ufb02amma- tion and \ufb01brosis [96]. Furthermore, as foreign particles in the lung would be removed either by mucociliary clearance or macrophage uptake, prolonged drug release exceeding i.e. 24 h by means of polymeric particles is extremely challenging in vivo; however, these may allow treatment that is targeting pulmonary macrophage (i.e. for treatment of latent tuberculosis). Hence, in vivo and clinical studies on the safety and ef\ufb01cacy of inhaled polymeric formulations are needed to \ufb01ll this knowledge gap. Key studies on polymeric formulations of inhaled antibiotics are listed in Table 2. 2.4.1. Cipro\ufb02oxacin Sustained-released powders of cipro\ufb02oxacin and doxycycline have been prepared by co-spray drying hydrochloride salts of both drugs with PVA [97]. It was found that the incorporation of PVA slowed down the release of both hydrophilic antibiotics, with less than 50% of the drugs dissolved in the pH 7.4 phosphate buffer for the PVA formula- tion in 6 h compared to more than 90% dissolved for the pure drugs, measured by a modi\ufb01ed Franz diffusion cell [97]. 2.4.2.

Tobramycin A chitosan-modi\ufb01ed PLGA nanoparticle suspension of tobramycin was prepared by the emulsion/solvent diffusion method [100]. Sustained drug release was achieved in vitro in the pH 7.2 phosphate buffer for up to 30 days. The MIC of the nanoparticle suspension against P. aeruginosa was ten-fold higher than pure tobramycin, and severe in vitro cytotoxicity of the nanosuspension on human alveolar epithelial cells (A549) was observed. Based on results obtained from the MTT assay, an approximate 82% reduction in cell viability was observed for the blank chitosan-modi\ufb01ed nanoparticle suspension compared to 50% reduction for the tobramycin-loaded nanoparticles at a concentra- tion of 1 mg/ml [100]. In the light of these \ufb01ndings, caution should be exercised when developing drug-loaded polymeric nanoparticles for pulmonary delivery. 2.4.4. Anti-tuberculosis agents Micro- and nano-sized polymeric particles containing encapsulated ri- fampicin, a \ufb01rst-line anti-tuberculosis drug, have been investigated exten- sively. The \ufb02ake-like dihydrate particles of rifampicin were coated with PLGA or polylactide (PLA) using a spray dryer equipped with a multi- channel nozzle to reduce the initial drug release and protect the micro- crystals from chemical decomposition [101]. The emulsion\u2013solvent-evap- oration method has also been used to produce PLGA-rifampicin particles [102\u2013105]. Drug loading ef\ufb01ciencies and particle size were found to be hi", "rug release and protect the micro- crystals from chemical decomposition [101]. The emulsion\u2013solvent-evap- oration method has also been used to produce PLGA-rifampicin particles [102\u2013105]. Drug loading ef\ufb01ciencies and particle size were found to be highly dependent on the shear forces and formulation parameters such as aqueous phase volume and polymer concentration [106]. Pre-mix membrane emulsi\ufb01cation has also been employed [102, 104,107]. In this technique, a polymer emulsion with narrow particle distribution is generated through a Shirasu Porous Glass membrane with known pore sizes into a continuous phase containing surfactants. Hu et al. showed that the initial burst release of rifampicin from PLGA microparticles produced by this method could be avoided by coating with sodium alginate [108]. Other production methods include the electrostatic drop generation approach for the preparation of sodium alginate microparticles loaded with 22% rifapentine [109] and an ionic gelation method for the production of isoniazid-loaded chitosan/ tripolyphosphate nanoparticles [110]. 2.5. Nanoparticle formulations Inhalable nanoparticle formulations are advantageous for the purposes of improving the solubility and dissolution rates of water- insoluble drugs as well as minimising premature mucociliary clearance of drugs [111]. Inhaled nanoparticles could be exhaled during DPI administration due to their extremely low mass. This problem has been solved by formulating nanoparticles into inhalable micro- aggregates via spray drying [112\u2013114] or spray-freeze-drying [115, 116] with mannitol [113,116], PVA, or leucine as matrix materials.

The micro-sized aggregates generated by spray-freeze drying exhibited superior aerosolisation performance compared to those produced by spray drying [112] and this was attributed to the porous structure and low density of the particles [116,117]. However, the toxicities of inhaled nanoparticles deserve further investigations. Key studies on nanoparti- cle formulations of inhaled antibiotics are listed in Table 3. 2.5.1. Amikacin Varshosaz and co-workers optimised a solvent diffusion technique for the production of solid lipid nanoparticles of approximately 150 nm in size with a high drug loading ef\ufb01ciency of 88% [118]. Freeze drying was employed to improve the long-term stability of the nanoparticles [119,120]. Results showed that the MIC and minimum bac- teriostatic concentration of amikacin nanoparticles against P. aeruginosa was less than half of the values for free amikacin, indicating enhanced anti-microbial activity [119,120]. 2.5.2. Cipro\ufb02oxacin Nanoparticle suspensions of cipro\ufb02oxacin base were produced by sonicating a colloidal dispersion of drug in acetone with L-leucine added into the suspension as a matrix material. The inhalable aggre- gates subsequently produced by freeze-drying were characterized by a high FPF total (b5.8 \u03bcm) of 81% measured via a Monodose inhaler at a \ufb02ow rate of 30 l/min [121]. Furthermore, the nanoparticle agglomerates exhibited an accelerated dissolution pro\ufb01le compared to the supplied cipro\ufb02oxacin base powder [121]. 2.5.3.

Tobramycin Nanoparticles of tobramycin were prepared by the conventional high-pressure homogenisation approach in the presence of a surfactant (sodium glycocholate) to improve its dispersion [122].

This was signi\ufb01- cantly higher than that of micronized tobramycin which was found to be 36%. 2.5.4. Vancomycin Savara Pharmaceuticals has developed an inhalable dry powder form of vancomycin hydrochloride (AeroVanc\u2122) [123\u2013125]. The formulation of AeroVanc\u2122has not been disclosed but data from a Phase I clinical study in healthy volunteers reported excellent tolerability and favourable pharmacokinetic pro\ufb01les [126]. 2.6. Combination formulations of antibiotics Mono-therapy of antibiotics may lead to the development of antibiotic resistance [127]. Hence, combination therapies containing different types of antibiotics have been extensively used clinically to prevent the emergence of drug resistance [128]. Drug combinations should be carefully selected to exploit any potential synergism or even antagonism in their anti-bacterial activities. An early study of the anti- microbial activity of a co-spray-dried combination of cipro\ufb02oxacin and doxycycline hydrochloride (1:1) carried out based on the disc diffusion method revealed minimal changes in the inhibition zone diameter of the combination against Staphylococcus aureus, P. aeruginosa and Streptococcus pyrogenes [129]. However, suppressive effects have been reported for this combination against E. coli [130]. Therefore, both the measurement method and the target bacterial strain are critical in the selection ", "aureus, P. aeruginosa and Streptococcus pyrogenes [129]. However, suppressive effects have been reported for this combination against E. coli [130]. Therefore, both the measurement method and the target bacterial strain are critical in the selection of synergistic combinations of antibiotics. 2.6.1. Liquid formulations The combination of tobramycin with other antibiotics such as fosfomycin has resulted in synergistic anti-bacterial effects against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa in both in vitro and in vivo models [131]. MacLeod et al. discovered that fosfomycin enhanced the uptake of tobramycin in P. aeruginosa in a dose-dependent manner [132]. Co-administration of tobramycin with clarithromycin [133,134] and colistin [135] also exhibited enhanced anti-bio\ufb01lm activities. Results of a Phase II clinical trial on nebulised tobramycin/fosfomycin in CF pa- tients con\ufb01rmed the clinical anti-microbial ef\ufb01cacy against P. aeruginosa [136]. 2.6.2. Powder formulations Lee et al. developed a binary formulation comprising hydrochloride salts of cipro\ufb02oxacin and gati\ufb02oxacin as well as a ternary (binary plus lysozyme) combination of powders via spray drying (Fig. 1c) [137]. The binary combination showed a synergistic anti-microbial effect 89 Q.(T.) Zhou et al. / Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 85 (2015) 83\u201399", "against P. aeruginosa in a time-kill model [137]. The ternary combination resulted in an indifference interaction against P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter baumannii but may have potential mucolytic effects [138] in CF patients which deserve further investigation. Combination powder formulations consisting of tobramycin and other antibiotics including azithromycin, ceftazidime [139] or clarithromycin, were also produced by spray drying. Inhalable powders of tobramycin and ceftazidime were spray-dried with dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, albumin, and lactose with the purpose of producing highly dispersible porous particles [139]. Contrary to expectations, the spray-dried combination particles were not porous, possessed relatively low FPF values (b4.7 \u03bcm over the nominal dose) of 20\u201330% and displayed no synergistic anti-microbial action [139]. Spray drying suspended tobramycin in clarithromycin solution resulted in powders with improved aerosolisation performance compared to the corresponding physical mixture [140]. The FPF (b4.7 \u03bcm over the nominal dose), measured via the Axahaler\u00ae at a \ufb02ow rate of 100 l/min, increased from 35% (tobramycin) and 31% (clarithromycin) for the physical mixture to 65% and 63% for tobramycin and clarithromycin, respectively, in the combination formulation [140]. Selective combination powders of colistin and rifampicin were developed by co-spray drying based on apparent synergistic anti- microbial activities against A. baumannii [56] and P. aeruginosa. A high aerosolisation ef\ufb01ciency was achieved with an emitted dose of 96% and FPF total of 92% measured via an Aerolizer\u00ae device at 100 l/min [56]. This was attributed to the wrinkled particle shape (Fig. 1b) and surface coating of rifampicin. The FPF total of pure colisti", "ef\ufb01ciency was achieved with an emitted dose of 96% and FPF total of 92% measured via an Aerolizer\u00ae device at 100 l/min [56]. This was attributed to the wrinkled particle shape (Fig. 1b) and surface coating of rifampicin. The FPF total of pure colistin powder decreased from 80% to 63.2% when storage humidity increased from 60 to 75%. In strong contrast, the FPF total of the combination powder was unchanged when relative humidity was increased. It was postulat- ed that the hydrophobic rifampicin precipitated earlier than colistin on the particle surfaces during spray drying and this resulted in rifampicin dominating the surface composition of the particles and providing moisture protection for the combination powders. This was con\ufb01rmed by surface chemistry measurements using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and time-of-\ufb02ight secondary ion mass spectrometry [56]. Inhalable formulations consisting of \ufb01rst-line, second-line or a combination of both classes of anti-tuberculosis drugs have been well studied to re\ufb02ect current treatment regimens [137,141\u2013144]. Advanced formulations of polymeric particles have been extensively explored for anti-tuberculosis drugs [141\u2013143,145]. In terms of maximising the delivered dose to the patients, pure drug combinations are preferred. A key concern in the development of combination formulations pertains to their physiochemical stabilities. For example, when rifampicin is combined with either isoniazid, pyrazinamide or both, degradation of one or more drugs [146] was observed due to the formation of adduct-rifamycin isonicotinyl hydrazone [145]. A similar phenomenon was reported in the polymeric particles [145]. In a subsequent study by Chan, isoniazid and rifampicin were replaced by moxi\ufb02oxacin and rifapentine [137] and the powder formulatio", "of adduct-rifamycin isonicotinyl hydrazone [145]. A similar phenomenon was reported in the polymeric particles [145]. In a subsequent study by Chan, isoniazid and rifampicin were replaced by moxi\ufb02oxacin and rifapentine [137] and the powder formulation comprising this triple- combination of the anti-tuberculosis agents was prepared by co-spray drying (Fig. 1d) [137]. Addition of 10% w/w leucine was found to be essential to prevent overt crystallisation of pyrazinamide after long-term storage [137]. 2.7. Combination formulations containing non-antibiotic adjuvants Besides the combination of various antibiotics, the incorporation of non-antibiotic adjuvants in antibiotic formulations may potentially enhance their anti-microbial effects. Metallic cations (e.g. iron, calcium and magnesium) are essential for bacterial growth, microbial adherence and bio\ufb01lm formation. Metal-ion chelators are hence useful for combating multi-drug resistant bacteria by binding to these ions [147] . A combination formulation consisting of an ion chelator, citrate and taurolidine was shown to inhibit the growth of P. aeruginosa bio\ufb01lms [148]. Another ion chelator, lactoferrin, was reported to block bio\ufb01lm development of P. aeruginosa [149]. Osmotic agents such as mannitol may also be added as adjuvants. In CF patients, pathogens can reside in the thick mucus which forms an impenetrable boundary preventing the entry of antibiotics. Using an in vitro arti\ufb01cial mucus model, Yang et al. reported that the combination of mannitol with cipro\ufb02oxacin enhanced its anti-microbial effects against P. aeruginosa [150]. Such effects were attributed to the presence of mannitol which increased water in\ufb02ux to the arti\ufb01cial mucus and subsequently improved cipro\ufb02oxacin penetration through the mucus layer [150]. Howev", "ts anti-microbial effects against P. aeruginosa [150]. Such effects were attributed to the presence of mannitol which increased water in\ufb02ux to the arti\ufb01cial mucus and subsequently improved cipro\ufb02oxacin penetration through the mucus layer [150]. However, the dose of cipro\ufb02oxacin in the proportion (5% w/w) that was investigated in combination with mannitol was low. If the actual dose of cipro\ufb02oxacin as used in previous clinical trials (32.5 mg) [151] was combined with mannitol in a similar ratio, the total powder mass of each dose could amount up to a total of 650 mg. Further optimisation in the formulation may reduce the dose of total powder. Other potential bene\ufb01ts of adding mannitol to the inhaled antibiotic formulation include eradication of bacterial persistent cells [152,153], improved airway clearance associated with CF [154] and non-CF bronchiectasis [155]. Other reported non-antibiotic components include deoxyribonu- clease (DNase, a mucolytic) with enhanced anti-microbial effects on P. aeruginosa in arti\ufb01cial sputum [156] and beclomethasone dipropi- onate for the treatment of respiratory infections in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases [157]. Nitric oxide donors [158\u2013160] and D-amino acids [161] have also been shown in vitro bio\ufb01lm-dispersal effects. 2.8. Bacteriophage formulations Phage therapy represents a unique approach for the treatment of infections based on an anti-bacterial mechanism that is entirely different from the traditional antibiotics. Bacteriophage is a type of virus that infects and replicates itself inside bacterial cells. Phages have also acquired mechanisms to counter bacterial defences [162]. Furthermore, in many cases bacteria at the infection sites are protected from antibiotic penetration by a bio\ufb01lm barrier. Phages are", "d replicates itself inside bacterial cells. Phages have also acquired mechanisms to counter bacterial defences [162]. Furthermore, in many cases bacteria at the infection sites are protected from antibiotic penetration by a bio\ufb01lm barrier. Phages are able to penetrate the bio\ufb01lm, replicate locally to kill bacteria and can also potentially restore antibiotic ef\ufb01cacy [163\u2013165]. Formulating bacteriophages as inhalable dry powders is generally preferred to improve patient adherence and product stability. Making biologically stable phages as dry powders is critical as stability impacts on the cost and ef\ufb01cacy of treatment. Conventional powder technologies such as mechanical milling are unsuitable as the energy and stresses produced are known to cause damage to biopharmaceuticals such as proteins [166\u2013180]. A Canadian aerosol research group led by Finlay and Vehring has undertaken pioneering studies on the formulation of phages as powders for inhalation [181,182]. Inhalable powders of bacteriophage KS4-M and \u03a6KZ with lactose/lactoferrin (60:40, w/w) were generated by lyophilisation followed by milling [182]. The lyophilisation process exhibited an acceptable loss of titre with c. 2 log10s for KS4-M (from 2.3 \u00b1 0.5 \u00d7 1010 to 1.1 \u00b1 0.5 \u00d7 108) and c. 1 log10 for \u03a6KZ (from 1.7 \u00b1 0.4 \u00d7 109 to 7.8 \u00b1 3.3 \u00d7 108). However, the FPF total measured at 60 l/min via the Aerolizer\u00ae was relatively low, in the range of 32\u201334% over the loaded dose. Improvements in the loss of titre and aerosolisation have been achieved by low-temperature spray drying with protective excipients. Dry powder formulations of bacteriophage KS4-M, KS14 and cocktails of phages \u03a6KZ/D3 and \u03a6KZ/D3/KS4-M, have been produced via spray drying at an inlet temperature of 75 \u00b0C and outlet temperatures ranging from 40\u201345 \u00b0C [1", "ng with protective excipients. Dry powder formulations of bacteriophage KS4-M, KS14 and cocktails of phages \u03a6KZ/D3 and \u03a6KZ/D3/KS4-M, have been produced via spray drying at an inlet temperature of 75 \u00b0C and outlet temperatures ranging from 40\u201345 \u00b0C [181]. Casein sodium salt and \u03b1-trehalose were added as protective agents, surfactants like Tyloxapol and Pluronic F68 as wet dispersing agents and L-leucine as a powder aerosolisation enhancer. The optimised formulation had a total lung mass of approximately 70% determined via the Aerolizer\u00ae at 90 l/min and the titre loss was 90 Q.(T.)

Future in vivo studies are needed to further con\ufb01rm the ef\ufb01cacies of these new inhaled anti-microbial therapies. 3. Inhaled antiviral formulations 3.1. Zanamivir Only zanamivir is approved for inhalation use in US (Relenza\u00ae, GlaxoSmithKline, Middlesex, UK). In Relenza\u00ae Rotadisk\u00ae, each blister contains a mixture of 5 mg zanamivir and 20 mg lactose [183]. Patients are to inhale the contents of two blisters, twice a day for \ufb01ve days. Signi\ufb01cant reductions in the median time to relieve the symptoms were reported to be 1.25 days in in\ufb02uenza positive patients (5\u201312 years old) [184]. The Diskhaler\u00ae is a low resistance device (0.022 kPa1/2/(l/min)) which generates a \ufb02ow rate of 90 l/min at a 4 kPa pressure drop across the inhaler [185]. An in vitro study using the Next Generation Impactor revealed FPF less than 30% even at a high \ufb02ow rate of 90 l/min with most of powder retentions found in the pre-separator (45.4 \u00b1 5.0%) and the device (20.9 \u00b1 5.2%) [185]. Using a breath simulator, generating a peak inspiratory \ufb02ow of 84 l/ min and 2.78 L of air and a realistic physical airway model instead of a USP throat, a similar lung dose was obtained [186]. Data obtained from atomic force microscopy has additionally uncovered doubling increase of adhesion force (240 nN to 582 nN) between spray-dried lactose (dv, 0.5 = 150 \u03bcm with geometric standard deviation of 1.8) and micronized zanamivir (dv, 0.5 = 2.5 \u03bcm with geometric standard deviation of 1.5) when the relative humidity was increased from 32% to 85% [187]. This \ufb01nding indicated that the already low FPF could be further decreased in high humidity. The low lung dose could be one of the reasons why Relenza\u00ae gained poor acceptance in the market. Relenza\u00ae only managed to dominate 25% of anti-in\ufb02uenza market in USA when", "indicated that the already low FPF could be further decreased in high humidity. The low lung dose could be one of the reasons why Relenza\u00ae gained poor acceptance in the market. Relenza\u00ae only managed to dominate 25% of anti-in\ufb02uenza market in USA when it was \ufb01rst marketed in 1999/2000 [188]. In addition, worldwide safety warning involving risk of bronchospasm was then issued which triggered GSK to reduce marketing for Relenza\u00ae and further caused the sales to drop even more [188]. Another reason for the poor acceptance is the dif\ufb01culty in using the Diskhaler\u00ae. A survey, conducted in Okinawa during the 2010 \ufb02u season, found the administration of zanamivir using Diskhaler\u00ae to be the most dif\ufb01cult compared with the administration of oseltamivir (oral tablet) and laninamivir (powder inhaler) [188]. A randomised controlled trial found that elderly people (N65 years old.), where 80% of in\ufb02uenza related death occurs, cannot use the Diskhaler\u00ae correctly [189]. Even directly after training, 50% (19 out of 38 elderly patients) of the subjects failed to load and prime the device correctly. This number increased to 65% after 24 h of training. Loading and priming the device consist of too many steps, starting with the squeezing of the side of the tray to remove it from the device, placing the Rotadisk\u00ae in the tray, inserting the tray back into the device and puncturing the blister. Unless the inhaler is improved, the delivery of zanamivir to treat in\ufb02uenza in elderly patients is unlikely to be ef\ufb01cient. Relenza\u00ae is a formulation strictly for inhalation. One fatal incident occurred when Relenza\u00ae was nebulised and given to a mechanically ventilated adult patient suffering from severe H1N1 in\ufb02uenza A. The lac- tose in Relenza\u00ae formulation triggered ventilator occlusion causing the patien", "or inhalation. One fatal incident occurred when Relenza\u00ae was nebulised and given to a mechanically ventilated adult patient suffering from severe H1N1 in\ufb02uenza A. The lac- tose in Relenza\u00ae formulation triggered ventilator occlusion causing the patient to have severe hypoxemia (SpO2 dropped to 71\u201378%) and bilater- al pneumothoraces [190]. The Relenza\u00ae manufacturer, GlaxoSmithKline, further clari\ufb01ed that this formulation is not to be reconstituted in any liquid formulation for nebulisation [191]. The aqueous saline solution of zanamivir that has been used for nebulisation does not contain lactose [192]. 3.2. Laninamivir Laninamivir octanoate (LANI) is the newest neuraminidase inhibi- tors currently only approved in Japan (Inavir\u00ae, Daiichi Sankyo Company Ltd, Tokyo, Japan and Biota Pharmaceuticals, Alpharetta, USA). It is an antiviral drug that has long retention in the lungs and is able to remain for more than 5 days and hence requires only a single inhalation as opposed to the twice daily \ufb01ve days treatment course for zanamivir [193]. In an animal study, t1/2 (time to half the concentration of LANI soon after administration) was 41.4 h and even at 120 h post-dose, concentration of LANI in the lung was considerable higher than IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) [194]. The median duration required for fever and \ufb02u symptoms to disappear was three to four days (including days of administration) in patients having type A and B in\ufb02u- enza, respectively [195]. Patients need to inhale the required dose from a single-use disposable TwinCaps\u00ae inhaler (Hovione Farmaciencia, SA, Portugal). TwinCaps\u00ae is a high resistance device (0.057 kPa1/2/(l/min)) which generates a \ufb02ow rate of 35 l/min at a pressure drop of 4 kPa across the device [196].

TwinCaps\u00ae is a high resistance device (0.057 kPa1/2/(l/min)) which generates a \ufb02ow rate of 35 l/min at a pressure drop of 4 kPa across the device [196]. A low \ufb02ow of 20 l/min was claimed to be suf\ufb01cient to achieve effective delivery [196]. Inavir\u00ae manufacturer, Daiichi Sankyo, further claimed that the FPF is consistent in the range of 1.2 kPa (corresponding to 19 l/min)\u2013 4 kPa and therefore suitable for patients with weak inhalation strength [197]. However, the FPF values and device retention were not available in the open literature. Post-marketing surveillance conducted by the company reported that more that 90% patients, ranging from 2 to 94 years old, were able to achieve suf\ufb01cient inhalation required for therapeutic delivery. Children (b10 years old) are required to inhale a total dose of 20 mg whilst 40 mg doses are to be inhaled for adults. The single administration of LANI is commonly done under the supervi- sion of health care professionals who ensure that the correct inhalation technique is adhered by the patients. Laninamivir has proven to be effective to the H1N1/H275Y virus and shown similar clinical ef\ufb01cacy to zanamivir and oseltamivir against H1N1, H3N2 and in\ufb02uenza B viruses [198,199]. Alleviation time for children was shorter with laninamivir compared to oseltamivir, whilst in adults the alleviation time is similar [200]. Moreover, animal studies have shown the superior ef\ufb01cacy of laninamivir against the highly pathogenic avian \ufb02u virus H5N1 [201].

Zhou et al. / Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 85 (2015) 83\u201399", "LANI has just completed a randomised, double-blind, placebo- controlled, parallel-arm Phase 2 clinical trial comparing the safety and ef\ufb01cacy of a 40 mg and a 80 mg dose to placebo in 639 patients. Interest- ingly, the study demonstrated a statistically signi\ufb01cant reduction in viral shedding on day 3 for those patients in both the 40 mg and 80 mg cohorts compared to placebo; however, neither two doses achieved a statistically signi\ufb01cant reduction in the median time to alleviation of in\ufb02uenza symptoms as measured by the Flu-iiQ patient-recorded outcome questionnaire [202]. The median time to alleviation of in\ufb02uenza symptoms was 102.3 h for the 40 mg cohort and 103.2 h for the 80 mg cohort, as compared to 104.1 h for the placebo cohort [202]. The reason is unclear that virus shedding did not translate into the alleviation of in\ufb02uenza symptoms. Therefore, full analysis and understanding of all the clinical data are essential prior to the further development of inhaled LANI. 3.3. Anti-in\ufb02uenza drugs under development It is only a matter of time before a mutated strain(s) emerged triggering resistance to the available antiviral drugs that targets the viral genes which encode the proteins that are susceptible to mutation [203,204]. Broad spectrum antiviral drugs that do not target these viral proteins will then be more valid since it will still be ef\ufb01cacious despite gene mutations of these viruses. Inhaled anti-in\ufb02uenza drugs under development but yet approved are listed in Table 4 including DAS181 [205], ribavirin [206], recombinant human catalase [207] and Cidovir [208]. 4.

The", "ant human catalase [207] and Cidovir [208]. 4. Inhaled anti-fungal formulations Immunocompromised patients with malignancy, hematologic disease, HIV, cancer and organ transplantation are highly susceptible to invasive pulmonary fungal infections. These infections cause unacceptably high mortality and morbidity rates (40\u201390%) and become an alarming healthcare problem [209,210]. A vast majority of the infected cases are caused by Candida spp. and Aspergillus spp. [211]. Oral and/or intravenous administrations of anti-fungal drugs, such as amphotericin B, \ufb02ucytosine and a handful of clinically available azole agents, are the mainstay in the treatment of pulmonary fungal infections [212]. However, these traditional treatments are unavoidably associated with different degree of systemic toxicities which often lead to early discontinuation of treatments, and hence have poor therapeutic outcomes. In the last two decades, increasing attention has been drawn to pulmonary delivery of anti-fungal agents for the prevention of inva- sive pulmonary fungal infections [213]. Yet, the administration of aerosolised antifungal agents is limited to case studies due to the lack of suf\ufb01cient clinical data on their ef\ufb01cacy and safety pro\ufb01les [213,214]. Whilst further well-designed clinical trials are required to establish their therapeutic roles and risks, here we will provide an update on the recent developments of anti-fungals designed for aerosol delivery (Table 5). 4.1. Amphotericin B Amphotericin B, which is a membrane-active polyene macrolide antifungal agent, has been the most commonly used therapy for the treatment of life-threatening pulmonary fungal infections and the most thoroughly studied agent for inhalation administration [215]. Liposomal amphotericin B dry powder inhaler formu", "e antifungal agent, has been the most commonly used therapy for the treatment of life-threatening pulmonary fungal infections and the most thoroughly studied agent for inhalation administration [215]. Liposomal amphotericin B dry powder inhaler formulation was developed by Shah and Misra [216]. However, majority of the studies are intended to demonstrate the feasibility of nebulising commercially available formulations, including Fungizone\u00ae (a deoxycholate formula- tion), Ambisome\u00ae (liposome-based formulation), Abelect\u00ae and Amphotec\u00ae (lipid-based formulations). The corresponding pharmaco- kinetics properties and safety pro\ufb01les have been summarised in Kuiper and Ruijgrok [217].

It is believed that the detrimental effect on lung function may be related to the deoxycholate component. Therefore, the recent work has been focused on studying the liposomal or other encapsulated formulations. Fauvel et al. [218] investigated the in vitro aerosol performance of liposomal amphotericin B delivered by a Atomiser NL9M nebuliser with an AOBOX compressor and con\ufb01rmed the ability to deliver the liposomal formulation to the alveolar compartment. They also tested the drug uptake and toxicity of drug at concentrations achievable by nebulisation on the A549 human lung epithelial cell line. Drug concentrations above the MIC of most Aspergillus species were reported, but amphotericin B approached levels potentially being cytotoxic to the cells. Their \ufb01ndings could possibly explain the inconsistency in the safety pro\ufb01le observed in various clinical studies [217] when different nebulisation set-ups and/or protocol were used. Gilani et al. [219] speci\ufb01cally formulated amphotericin B for jet nebulisation using chitosan\u2013stearic acid conjugate nanomicelles as the carrier. A solvent evaporation technique was used to incorporate the drug into nanomicelles in a size range of 101\u2013248 nm with encapsula- tion ef\ufb01ciency up to 97%. They found that the micelle size was decreased with increasing drug loading, which was attributed to the enhanced hydrophobic interaction between adjacent drug and stearic acid molecules.

The air-jet nebulised nanomicelle formulation showed a FPF (b6.4 \u03bcm) of 52% without compromising on drug stability after nebulisation. Alsaadi et al. [220] formulated amphotericin B-hydroxypropyl-g-cyclodextrin (1:100 w/w with 1 mg/ml amphotericin B) complex into non-ionic surfactant vesicles which was composed of mono-n-hexadecyl ether tetraethylene glycol, cholesterol, and dicetyl phosphate in a 3:3:1 molar ratio (30 or 150 mM lipid). The formulations were freeze-dried to extend the shelf-life and then rehydrated with water for nebulisation using a Buxco\u00ae nebulisation system to treat leishmania- sis. A treatment with 5 doses of aerosolised non-ionic surfactant vesicle formulation (once daily for 5 consecutive days with a total dose of 12.65 mg drug/kg) exhibited enhanced anti-fungal performance com- pared with treatment using amphotericin B-dextrin solution in a mice model. 4.2. Itraconazole Itraconazole is a highly hydrophobic and weakly basic broad spec- trum anti-fungal azole available as oral and intravenous formulations (e.g. Sporanox\u00ae). There are strong interests to develop inhalable formu- lations of itraconazole because of its low aqueous solubility (1 ng/ml at pH 7), coupled with the requirement of a high therapeutic concentra- tion (0.5 \u03bcg/g lung tissue or 0.5 \u03bcg/ml blood), as well as its poor and erratic absorption characteristics [221].

Even so, improving drug disso- lution and/or solubility remains a challenge for pulmonary delivery of itraconazole to treat invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. A common strategy to enhance the dissolution rate of poorly water-soluble drugs is to reduce the drug particle size to the nanometer scale, which results in very large speci\ufb01c surface area for dissolution [222,223].

Major \ufb01ndings are summarised in Yang et al. [224]. Brie\ufb02y, nebulised itraconazole nanoparticle formulations were able to deliver the drug to the alveoli; improved bioavailability and in-vivo prophylactic effects of inhaled itraconazole formulations were achieved compared with the Sporanox\u00ae oral formulation [224]. Whilst particle size reduction signi\ufb01cantly enhances the dissolution rate of itraconazole, the potential impact of polymorphs on the solubil- ity of drug was also recognised. Yang et al. [225] compared the bioavail- ability of nano-crystalline and amorphous itraconazole formulations, which were prepared by wet-milling and ultra-rapid freezing techniques, respectively. Single-dose (20 mg/ml in 5 ml suspension) was nebulised to Sprague\u2013Dawley rats using a nose-only dosing apparatus. They found that the systemic bioavailability of the amorphous formulation (peak concentration of 180 ng/ml at 4 h after dosing) was 3.8 times higher than that of the crystalline counterpart, despite similar aero- dynamic performance and lung deposition of the two formulations. This was attributed to the rapid dissolution of the amorphous nanoparticles and higher levels of supersaturation which was de\ufb01ned as the ratio of drug concentration to the equilibrium solubility (4.7 times of the crystal- line formulation). A wet-milled itraconazole nanosuspension containing polysorbate 80 (itraconazole: polysorbate 80 = 86:14, 10% total solid content) was shown to improve bioavailability in a rat model [221]. A dose of 22.5 mg/kg was nebulised and a systemic peak concentration of 104 ng/ml 4 h after dosing was reached. This formulation could result in longer ex", "80 = 86:14, 10% total solid content) was shown to improve bioavailability in a rat model [221]. A dose of 22.5 mg/kg was nebulised and a systemic peak concentration of 104 ng/ml 4 h after dosing was reached. This formulation could result in longer exposure of the lung tissue to itraconazole (14.3 \u03bcg/g lung tissue 24 h after dosing). Such features are important for a poorly water-soluble drug to enhance its ef\ufb01cacy, but drug dosing should be carefully consid- ered to avoid systemic toxicity. For the development of DPI formulations, Jafarinejad et al. [226] employed a modi\ufb01ed ionic gelation approach to encapsulate itraconazole into chitosan-based nanoparticle (190\u2013240 nm) with an encapsulation ef\ufb01ciency of up to 55%. The nanosuspension was then spray dried with and without excipients (lactose, mannitol and leucine) to produce inhalable microparticles. The highest FPF obtained was 43% for a formula- tion containing 10% mannitol and 10% leucine using a Cyclohaler\u00ae at 60 l/min for 4 s. A nanoparticle-based dry powder formulation was also proposed by Duret et al. [227]. Itraconazole suspensions were produced by high-pressure homogenization and stabilised by 10% tocopherol polyethylene 1000 (10% w/w), then co-spray dried with mannitol and/ or sodium taurocholate. They found that the nanoparticle formulation has a much higher FPF (46.2\u201363.2%) and solubility (58\u201396 ng/ml) compared to the microparticle-based itraconazole formulations (23.1% and b10 ng/ml). Amorphous dry powder formulations were prepared by spray drying itraconazole solution with mannitol and/ or hydrogenated soy-lecithin (phospholipid) as excipients. High FPF (46.9\u201367.0%) was obtained and the addition of phospholipid (10%) resulted in a signi\ufb01cantly higher dissolution rate [227]. Duret et al. [228] compared the b", "lution with mannitol and/ or hydrogenated soy-lecithin (phospholipid) as excipients. High FPF (46.9\u201367.0%) was obtained and the addition of phospholipid (10%) resulted in a signi\ufb01cantly higher dissolution rate [227]. Duret et al. [228] compared the bioavailabilities of three itraconazole- containing dry powder formulations: micronized crystalline powder, amorphous powders with and without phospholipid. A single dose (0.5 mg/kg) of each of the powders was endotracheally insuf\ufb02ated into mice. The amorphous formulations had a higher systemic bioavailability (plasmatic AUC0\u201324 h of 491.5 ng/ml without phospholipid and 376.8 ng/ml with phospholipid) compared with the micronized crystalline itraconazole formulation (182 ng/ml). Though the addition of phospholipid increased the wetting and absorption of the itraconazole powders, a faster elimination rate from the lung tissue was also observed (elimination half-life of 4.1 h). On the other hand, amorphous powders without phospholipid had an extended pulmonary retention (elimination half-life of 14.7 h), even higher than the crystalline formulation (elimination half-life of 6.5 h). With the improved local bioavailability, careful dosing of the dry powder formulations may achieve suf\ufb01cient anti-fungal activity with minimum systemic toxicity. 4.3. Voriconazole Voriconazole is a broad-spectrum anti-fungal agent and available as oral and intravenous products (e.g. Vfend\u00ae and Captisol\u00ae). Though it is 700 times more soluble than itraconazole, its low aqueous solubility (0.61 mg/ml at pH 7) remains a challenge in formulation design. The ef\ufb01cacy of inhaled voriconazole therapy was demonstrated in three life- threatening invasive aspergillosis cases when systemic voriconazole treatments were withdrawn due to severe adverse effects [214].", " remains a challenge in formulation design. The ef\ufb01cacy of inhaled voriconazole therapy was demonstrated in three life- threatening invasive aspergillosis cases when systemic voriconazole treatments were withdrawn due to severe adverse effects [214]. Intravenous formulation was nebulised to introduce 40 mg voriconazole to patients without attempts to control their respiratory pattern. After a 3 month treatment, all patients were reported to return to good conditions with minimal or no adverse effects reported during and 6 months after the therapy. Dry powder-based inhalation formulations of voriconazole were developed by Beinborn and co-workers using a thin \ufb01lm freezing technique [229]. Various process parameters, type/grade of stabilising excipient, drug to excipient ratio, solvents and solid contents were examined [229]. Whilst microstructure low density crystalline aggre- gates (speci\ufb01c surface area = 10 m2/g) were produced in the absence of excipients, addition of PVP as a stabilising agent produced low density amorphous nanostructure voriconazole aggregates (speci\ufb01c surface area = 15\u2013180 m2/g). When the powders were assessed using a Handihaler\u00ae at 60 l/min, the highest \ufb01ne particle fraction was obtained in an excipient-free formulation (42.4%) and a formulation stabilised by PVP K12 at a drug to excipient ratio of 1:2 (43.1%). In a follow up study [229], the microstructure crystalline voriconazole gave more favourable pharmacokinetics in lung tissues (AUC0\u201324 h = 452.6 \u03bcg h/g) compared with the amorphous nanostructure aggregates formulation (AUC0\u2013 24 h = 232.1 \u03bcg h/g) after a 10 mg/kg insuf\ufb02ated dose. The low retention of voriconazole in the lung tissue for the amorphous nanostructure ag- gregates was attributed to its faster dissolution rate, similar to the \ufb01nd- i", "ggregates formulation (AUC0\u2013 24 h = 232.1 \u03bcg h/g) after a 10 mg/kg insuf\ufb02ated dose. The low retention of voriconazole in the lung tissue for the amorphous nanostructure ag- gregates was attributed to its faster dissolution rate, similar to the \ufb01nd- ing of adding phospholipid to the amorphous microparticle itraconazole formulation [228]. In such case, the bene\ufb01ts brought by faster dissolu- tion were out-weighed by the rapid elimination of drugs from the lungs as well as the potential risk of getting plasma peak concentration related side effects. 5. Conclusions Inhaled anti-microbial therapy is an emerging and rapidly expanding area. As systemic exposure of many high-dose anti-microbials can cause severe adverse effects, inhalation therapy provides an attractive solution that allows the establishment of high localized drug concentrations in the respiratory tract with minimal systemic drug exposure. In reality, it is challenging to formulate high-dose anti-microbial agents into inhaled dosage forms as the dose, dosing frequency and site of action of inhaled antibiotics are substantially different from those for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Delivery of high-dose drugs via tradition- al nebulisation may require lengthy treatment durations. High drug doses in a DPI also preclude or limit the use of carriers or other functional excipients as these would signi\ufb01cantly increase the bulk volume of total dose and necessitate a bulkier device or a larger number of doses. Techno- logical advances are essential to maximise drug delivery ef\ufb01ciencies and convenience of use. Nebulisation is still the mainstay of inhaled therapy for the treat- ment of respiratory infections.

Nebulisation is still the mainstay of inhaled therapy for the treat- ment of respiratory infections. However, traditional jet nebulisers, with their long administration times and low delivery ef\ufb01ciencies, do not meet the stringent requirements of inhaled high-dose antibiotics. These problems have been largely solved by the development of mesh nebulisers. Apart from nebulisers, DPIs are also becoming popular and have attracted rising interest in recent years for the delivery of inhaled high-dose antibiotics. Their popularity stems from their enhanced sta- bilities, the ability to administer high drug doses within relatively shorter durations of time and ease of use. Cough and throat irritation are some common problems caused by the inhalation of high-dose of 94 Q.(T.)

With advanced particle engineering techniques and intelligent inhaler designs, it is expected that the delivery performance and patient adher- ence of antibiotic DPIs would improve further. Liposomal, polymeric and nanoparticle formulations of inhaled antibiotics are advanced drug delivery systems designed for the purposes of targeting drug delivery, sustaining drug release and enhancing the anti-microbial activities of antibiotics in the lungs. In vivo safety and ef\ufb01cacy evaluations particularly clinical studies are essential to the further development of such advanced formulations. Given that no new antibiotics are in the advanced development stage against Gram-negative multi-drug resistant bacteria, innovative formulations of existing antibiotics are of paramount importance to win the long-term war against the respiratory \u2018super bugs\u2019.

Introduction The COVID-19, the disease caused by a novel coronavirus and named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread rapidly across the globe. It has caused outbreaks of illness due to person-to-person transmission of the virus mainly via close contacts and droplets produced by an infected person\u2019s cough or sneeze [1]. Exhaled droplets from infected patients with COVID-19 can deposit in the noses, mouths, and eyes of people nearby. They can also be inhaled into the lungs and leads to respiratory illness such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Although aerosol therapy is a mainstay procedure used to treat pulmonary diseases at home and healthcare settings, it has a potential for fugitive emissions during therapy due to the generation of aerosols and droplets as a source of respiratory pathogens. Fugitive emission is defined as aerosols that have been released from the aerosol device during patient expiration. It is also medical aerosols that are not inhaled by the patient but passes into the atmosphere. According to previous studies, the particle size of fugitive emissions ranges from 0.860 to 1.437 \u03bcm and up to 50% of the generated aerosol during therapy was fugitive aerosol remain airborne in the indoor environment for several hours [2\u20136]. The device, interface, patient type, and flow rate affect the quantity and ch", " ranges from 0.860 to 1.437 \u03bcm and up to 50% of the generated aerosol during therapy was fugitive aerosol remain airborne in the indoor environment for several hours [2\u20136]. The device, interface, patient type, and flow rate affect the quantity and characteristics of the fugitive emissions, while the di\u00ad mensions and layout of the room, air turbulence, airflow rates, and temperature impact dispersion and decay [4,7,8]. In a recent in vitro study, a home attending healthcare worker was simulated with a manikin using a facemask that was placed at three different distances. The findings of this study showed that total aerosol concentration ranged from 0.002 to 0.10 mg/m3, depending on the distance of the manikin relative to the aerosol source [9]. Although previous studies showed an increase in the quantity of aerosol concentration in the ambient air, it is important to note that they are in vitro studies that cannot differentiate medical aerosol from bioaerosol. While bioaerosols are generated by patients, medical aerosols are produced by aerosol devices. It is clear that COVID-19 is spread by droplets generated as bioaerosols. Also, it has been reported that aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is plausible because the virus can remain viable and in\u00ad fectious in aerosols for hours [10,11]. For instance, most of the contamination seems to be from surfaces where the droplets settle and persist for up to a week. That is why dispersion distance of aerosols is such an important point.

The studies conducted by Hui et al. identified dispersion distances depending on the aerosol gener\u00ad ating procedures and the intervention (like mask over cannula) [12\u201316]. Therefore, the \u201cradius of risk\u201d associated procedures can offer some guidance for healthcare professionals at the bedside. Delivering aerosolized medications to patients with COVID-19 can aggravate the spread of the novel coronavirus. This has been a real concern for caregivers and healthcare professionals who are susceptible to unintended inhalation of fugitive emissions during therapy. Due to a scarcity of information in this area of clinical practice, the purpose of this paper is to explain how to deliver aerosolized medications to mild-, sub-intensive, and intensive-patients with COVID-19 and how to protect staff from exposure to exhaled droplets during aerosol therapy. Aerosol Therapy in Mild-Patients with COVID-19: While aerosol therapy is a critical and integral part of the clinical management of patients with pulmonary diseases, it increases the droplet generation and risk of disease transmission. Therefore, it is crucial to avoid un\u00ad necessary aerosol drug delivery to patients with COVID-19. According to previous research, patients with asthma have a risk for other coronavi\u00ad ruses such as middle eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS- CoV) infection and have a potential risk for COVID-19 [17]. However, in spontaneously breathing patients with COPD or asthma, the routine use of aerosolized medications is essential to keep the disease symptoms under control. While some reports have suggested avoiding the use of corticosteroids during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to note that the reports were m", "a, the routine use of aerosolized medications is essential to keep the disease symptoms under control. While some reports have suggested avoiding the use of corticosteroids during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to note that the reports were made based on data obtained in hospitalized pa\u00ad tients with COVID-19 who had a poor response to systemic corticoste\u00ad roids after the onset of the disease. Therefore, the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) recommends using prescribed inhaled corticosteroids to prevent the worsening of asthma and the serious consequences of asthma attacks [18]. Also, there is a lack of information on the risk of patients taking oral or inhaled corticosteroids for asthma control or risk of poor outcomes from coronavirus. In mild-patients with COVID-19 who are awake and can perform specific breathing techniques with inhalers, clinicians should consider using pressurized metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs) and dry powder in\u00ad halers (DPIs) for aerosol drug delivery instead of nebulizers. It is essential to use a valved-holding chamber with pMDIs during treatment. Also, priming before first use, pMDI actuation at the beginning of inspiration, hand breath coordination, inhalation with low inspiratory flows, and breath-hold is vital for the efficiency of pMDI. Since DPIs are breath-actuated inhalers, clinicians should emphasize the specific inspiratory flow needed to draw medication from the device and disperse the particles. Thus, patients can operate the DPI correctly and receive therapeutic benefit from the drug. However, patients with acute respiratory failure may not generate the adequate inspiratory flow needed for the specific DPI used for treatment. In addition, if the inhaler increases cough, other alternatives should be pursued. Using nebulizers ", "drug. However, patients with acute respiratory failure may not generate the adequate inspiratory flow needed for the specific DPI used for treatment. In addition, if the inhaler increases cough, other alternatives should be pursued. Using nebulizers with a mouthpiece or high flow nasal cannula should be considered in such cases. Unlike inhalers, nebulizers can deliver a variety of drug formulations that may be needed for patients with COVID-19. Although conventional jet nebulizers are commonly used to deliver aerosolized medications, they may also spew 2/3 of the emitted aerosol into the ambient envi\u00ad ronment [19\u201321]. In this case, healthcare providers are exposed not only the inhaled medications but also to the droplets from the patient\u2019s air\u00ad ways and lungs. In addition, the driving gas up to 10 L/min can increase the dispersion of both medical and bioaerosols. If aerosols generated with nebulizers carry the virus during exhalation and transmit it to the hospital environment, health care providers and other patients are under the risk of infection. Recently, some companies manufacturing jet nebulizers provided filters to use with their device in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. While the placement of a filter to the nebulizer was 93% effective in capturing exhaled aerosol droplets [22] and will reduce second hand exposure of aerosol medication to health care pro\u00ad fessionals [23,24], the efficiency of these filters in preventing the transmission and the magnitude of the risk acquiring coronavirus through filtered nebulizers are not fully known. Also, current publica\u00ad tions on fugitive emissions are based on in vitro studies that may not be a true representative of a real exhalation in coronavirus infected patients. Using the high-efficiency particulate air (HEP", "bulizers are not fully known. Also, current publica\u00ad tions on fugitive emissions are based on in vitro studies that may not be a true representative of a real exhalation in coronavirus infected patients. Using the high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters with nebulizers might be a good option during aerosol drug delivery to patients with COVID-19. Due to a greater surface of filtration, they are more effective in collecting droplets compared to other bacterial filters available on the market. However, their bulky designs and requirement to use various adapters to attach them to nebulizers make it difficult to use them compared to low volume bacteria filters. Interface selection is as important as device selection in aerosol therapy. Using a facemask is not recommended for aerosol therapy in the treatment of coronavirus infected patients. When a jet nebulizer is combined with a facemask, the airflow of jet nebulizer will force aerosol out of the device during expiration and breath-hold. McGrath et al. showed that the face mask had the highest-time averaged fugitively emitted aerosol concentration when a jet nebulizer was combined with a facemask. They also reported that placing a filter on the exhalation port of the mouthpiece lead to the lowest concentration [6]. Therefore, the jet nebulizers need to be used with the mouthpiece, and clinicians should attach filters or one-way valves to the large bore tubing of the nebulizer to prevent fugitive emissions during aerosol therapy. Another option would be to use a mesh nebulizer combined with the mouthpiece in patients with COVID-19. In this case, clinicians should add a filter to the other end of the mouthpiece to eliminate the release of aerosols to the environment. Many suspected patients with COVID-19 are recommend", "lizer combined with the mouthpiece in patients with COVID-19. In this case, clinicians should add a filter to the other end of the mouthpiece to eliminate the release of aerosols to the environment. Many suspected patients with COVID-19 are recommended to stay at home. Telehealth would be a good option to evaluate them at home and minimize the utilization of healthcare facilities by them. Smart phones can be used to provide telehealth services to patients with COVID-19 as they are equivalent of a hand-held computer. Although healthcare providers and patients do not need to be in the same physical location, there are some challenges with the use of telehealth in this pandemic. For instance, the healthcare provider cannot measure the temperature if the patient does not have a thermometer at home. Lighting at the pa\u00ad tient\u2019s home can make assessing cyanosis difficult. Evaluation of throat, nose or ears is also difficult if patient has upper respiratory symptoms. Using telehealth in this pandemic is a strategic initiative and achieving a careful balance of treatment effectiveness and patient safety require policy makers and stakeholders shape telehealth moving forward through a thoughtful framework for the practice, use and reimburse\u00ad ment of telehealth in coronavirus infected patients.

Ari", "Respiratory Medicine 167 (2020) 105987 3 Aerosol Therapy in Sub-Intensive-Patients with COVID-19: High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is commonly used in patients with hypox\u00ad emic respiratory failure [25\u201327]. Due to a limited number of ventilators available at hospitals, using HFNC may be a good option to use before patients with asthma and COPD develop severe hypoxemic respiratory failure. However, secondary inhalation of emissions released from the patients with COVID-19 using HFNC is a real concern. It leads to the risk of dispersion of aerosolized virus because HFNC does not have a closed circuit, unlike ventilators. Although previous studies showed a low risk of airborne transmission with HFNC when good interface fitting is achieved [14,16,28], the safety of using HFNC in patients with coro\u00ad navirus as well as the risk/benefit ratio for aerosol drug delivery through HFNC, has not been investigated. Previous research reported that increasing the flow decreased the fugitive emissions and particle size of aerosols during therapy [6]. If aerosolized medications need to be delivered through HFNC, clinicians should place surgical masks on the face of infected patients during HFNC [13,29,30] and administer aerosol therapy in negative pressure rooms. Respiratory therapists should also wear personal protective equipment, including an N95 respirator, gog\u00ad gles/face shield, double gloves, gown or apron if the gown is not fluid resistant. Table 2 includes a list of practical strategies for aerosol drug delivery to sub-intensive patients with COVID-19. Aerosol Therapy in Intensive-Patients with COVID-19: Recently published studies showed that two thirds of patients with COVID-19 develop acute respiratory distress syndrome [31].

Aerosol Therapy in Intensive-Patients with COVID-19: Recently published studies showed that two thirds of patients with COVID-19 develop acute respiratory distress syndrome [31]. It takes 9\u201310 days for patients with COVID-19 deteriorate and require intensive care for respiratory support [32]. Nebulizers may be needed in critically ill pa\u00ad tients with COVID-19 receiving ventilatory support. In this case, it is vital to keep the circuit intact and prevent the transmission of the virus. Therefore, delivering aerosolized medications via jet nebulizer or pMDIs will not be appropriate due to the breakage of the circuits for the placement of the device on the ventilator circuit before aerosol therapy. A recently published Chinese guideline suggests using the mesh nebu\u00ad lizer in critically ill patients with COVID-19 receiving ventilator support [30]. Mesh nebulizers can stay in-line for up to 28 days, and reservoir design allows adding medication without requiring the ventilator circuit to be broken for aerosol drug delivery. Unlike jet nebulizer, the medi\u00ad cation reservoir of mesh nebulizers is isolated from the breathing circuit that eliminates the nebulization of contaminated fluids. Also, placing the mesh or jet nebulizer prior to the humidifier can improve the efficiency of the treatment and further reduce retrograde contamination from the patient [33\u201338]. Also, it is important to remember that exhaled particles from intu\u00ad bated patients are less than 2 \u03bcm that do not deposit via sedimentation or inertial impaction. They remain suspended in the air and can pose a serious risk to healthcare professionals as low concentration exposure is sufficient for the transmission of coronavirus. In our previous research, we quantified the amount of aerosol collected at ", "ion. They remain suspended in the air and can pose a serious risk to healthcare professionals as low concentration exposure is sufficient for the transmission of coronavirus. In our previous research, we quantified the amount of aerosol collected at the exhaust outlet of a ventilator operated with and without filters in the expiratory limb of the circuit [23]. We found that drug deposited at the exhaust port without expiratory filters was >160 fold higher than with expiratory filters, and placing a filter in the expiratory limb significantly reduces secondhand aerosol exposure [23]. Since aerosol drug delivery to ventilator-dependent patients can readily be transmitted to the ambient environment, it is critical to use the HEPA filters to prevent the trans\u00ad mission of infectious droplet nuclei through the ventilators. Sometimes aerosol therapy is combined with pulmonary clearance techniques such as chest physical therapy and suctioning. Since coughing generates droplet nuclei capable of transmitting the corona\u00ad virus, it is not recommended to administer aerosolized medications along with chest physical therapy in the acute phase of the disease. If the patient with COVID-19 is intubated and needs endotracheal suctioning during mechanical ventilation, in-line, or closed system suction cathe\u00ad ters should be preferred as they can be utilized up to 7 days without having to break the ventilator circuit. Although there are multiple de\u00ad signs of closed suction catheters, no significant difference was found on aerosol drug delivery to simulated ventilator dependent adults using different designs of closed suction catheters [39]. Table 3 consists of a list of practical strategies for aerosol drug delivery to intensive-care patients with COVID-19. Infection Control during Aerosol T", " simulated ventilator dependent adults using different designs of closed suction catheters [39]. Table 3 consists of a list of practical strategies for aerosol drug delivery to intensive-care patients with COVID-19. Infection Control during Aerosol Therapy: The risk of exposure to exhaled aerosols among health care professionals has been a real concern in the COVID-19 pandemic. Aerosols entering the ambient environment increase the risk of exposure to the virus and may expose respiratory therapists and other healthcare professionals to the pathogen during patient treatment, monitoring, equipment cleaning, and main\u00ad tenance in the hospital setting. Previous research showed that exposure to the virus and poor compliance with infection control procedures are associated with occupationally acquired infection in healthcare settings [40\u201344]. Delivering aerosolized medications to patients with COVID-19 who have spontaneous breathing or receive noninvasive ventilation or high flow nasal cannula are of particularly high risk [45]. If aerosolized medications need to be used in patients with COVID-19, clinicians should isolate patients in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) or negative pressure rooms with a minimum of 12 air changes per hour or at least 160 liters/s/patient in facilities with natural ventilation. In addition, respiratory therapists and other health care professionals providing aerosol therapy should be trained on infection prevention and control recommendations for COVID-19. They must adhere to airborne precautions and use personal protective equipment properly. Hand hy\u00ad giene and double gloving should be a standard practice in all healthcare facilities. In addition, healthcare professionals should use surgical res\u00ad pirators such as N95 or FFP2 standard or", "ions and use personal protective equipment properly. Hand hy\u00ad giene and double gloving should be a standard practice in all healthcare facilities. In addition, healthcare professionals should use surgical res\u00ad pirators such as N95 or FFP2 standard or equivalent, goggles/face shield, gloves, gowns, and aprons (if gowns are not resistant to fluid) during aerosol therapy [46]. Cleaning hands before and after treatment with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer is extremely Table 2 Practical strategies for aerosol drug delivery to sub-intensive patients with COVID-19. 1.

Other infection control strategies include minimizing the number of times that healthcare workers enter the rooms of COVID-19 patients by bundling the activities/treatments and restricting others who are not involved in direct patient care from entering the patient\u2019s room. Currently, a shortage of surgical N95 respirators is expected. In this case, healthcare professionals should consider using the same mask in the treatment of multiple patients with COVID-19. However, previous studies reported that the use of the same respirator for more than 4 h might lead to discomfort [47,48]. This pandemic has taught us the importance of infection prevention and control measures as well as teamwork in health care settings. It is important for respiratory therapists to team up with other healthcare professionals in isolating coronavirus infected patients in AIIR and assigning designated staff who can provide effective and safe delivery of aerosolized medications to this patient population. Although respiratory therapists and other healthcare providers face a major and unique challenge in this pandemic, they are on the front stage and build a strong platform to ensure the health, safety and well-being of patients with coronavirus. The upside of this pandemic is that we can teach respira\u00ad tory therapists and other healthcare professionals the importance of personal protection and safe practices that might carry over for a safer workplace in the future.

However, it is imperative during the pandemic to assume that all patients may be infected, so good personal protection and aerosol administration practices should be applied. Clinical studies on COVID- 19 are limited, and there is a lack of information and guidance on how to administer aerosolized medications to this patient population. Also, the effective delivery of aerosolized medications to patients with COVID-19 may require modifications in the dose, frequency, and de\u00ad livery technique that need to be used during aerosol therapy . While our deepest fear is that we are inadequate in terms of resources and knowledge about coronavirus, the choice does not belong to pessimism and scare; it belongs to us. As Marie Curie said, \u201cnothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more so that we may fear less.\u201d We are strong when we know our fears and limitations. Therefore, it is time to start thinking about what is necessary and doing what is possible using a proactive and comprehensive approach to aerosol drug delivery to patients with COVID-19. Respira\u00ad tory therapists have enormous experience in aerosol therapy and the foundation of delivering aerosolized medications to coronavirus infec\u00ad ted patients should be grounded in their experience and current guide\u00ad lines on COVID-19.

Inhaled therapies are the backbone of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease management, helping to target therapy at the airways. Adherence to prescribed treatment is necessary to ensure achievement of the clinician\u2019s desired therapeutic effect. In the case of inhaled therapies, this requires patients\u2019 acceptance of their need for inhaled therapy together with successful mastery of the inhaler technique speci\ufb01c to their device(s). This article reviews a number of challenges and barriers that inhaled mode of delivery can pose to optimum adherence\u2014to therapy initiation and, thereafter, to successful implementation and persistence. The potential effects on adherence of different categories of devices, their use in multiplicity, and the mixing of device categories are discussed.

Common inhaler errors identi\ufb01ed by the international Implementing Helping Asthma in Real People (iHARP) study are summarized, and adherence intervention opportunities for health care professionals are offered. Better knowledge of common errors can help practicing clinicians identify their occurrence among patients and prompt remedial actions, such as tailored education, inhaler technique retraining, and/or shared decision making with patients regarding suitable alternatives. Optimizing existing therapy delivery, or switching to a suitable alternative, can help avoid unnecessary escalation of treatment and health care resources. \u0001 2016 The Authors.

Adherence to obstructive lung disease therapies involves patients initiating their prescribed therapy, implementing it as prescribed (ie, correctly administering the prescribed dose at the physician- directed frequency), and persisting with treatment. Also central to the therapeutic bene\ufb01t of inhaled therapies is their successful administration, which requires patients to have knowledge and understanding of (and ability to implement) the appropriate inhaler technique required to optimize both the dispensed and administered doses.3,4 A wide range of different devices are used to deliver short- and long-acting bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) drugs (alone or in combination) for the management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).1,2 Device types include pressurized metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs), used either alone or attached to spacers or valved holding chambers; breath-actuated pressurized metered-dose inhalers (ie, BAIs); dry powder inhalers (DPIs); or soft mist inhalers. There are more than 200 drug-inhaler device combinations (br", "pMDIs), used either alone or attached to spacers or valved holding chambers; breath-actuated pressurized metered-dose inhalers (ie, BAIs); dry powder inhalers (DPIs); or soft mist inhalers. There are more than 200 drug-inhaler device combinations (branded items and generic versions of existing brands) available.5 The wide variety of inhaler devices available simultaneously presents both op- portunities and challenges for patients and prescribers. Each class of device (pMDI, BAI, DPI, soft mist inhaler) is associated with a different approach to inhalation and, in turn, each device within those classes may request speci\ufb01c nuances to the general handling and inhalation technique to optimize delivery and administration. pMDIs, for example, dispense a standardized dose on depression of the canister and require the patients to coordinate the timing of the canister depression and their inhalation. BAIs try to minimize potential coordination errors between the timing of the actuation and breath intake by using the power of the patient\u2019s breath to trigger the actuation. Breath control is also key to the successful delivery of pMDIs (whether breathe-actuated or not) as inspiratory \ufb02ow combines with the energy of the pressurized dose delivery and, if too rapid, can result in oropharangeal deposition of the medication, rather than its delivery to the lungs. In contrast to pMDIs and BAIs, DPIs do not contain a propellant and use the patients\u2019 inspiratory \ufb02ow as both the trigger and the actuation energy for the dispensed dose. While DPIs therefore avoid the coordination issues pre- sented by pMDIs, the fact that they are inspiratory \ufb02owedriven means that the dispensed dose is also \ufb02ow dependent. Further- more, for each DPI there is a minimum inspiratory \ufb02ow required to achieve succe", " therefore avoid the coordination issues pre- sented by pMDIs, the fact that they are inspiratory \ufb02owedriven means that the dispensed dose is also \ufb02ow dependent. Further- more, for each DPI there is a minimum inspiratory \ufb02ow required to achieve successful dispensing of the prescribed therapeutic dose, something that may present a challenge for patients with compromised lung function, particularly during an exacerbation or, more generally, among elderly patients with COPD and young children with asthma. Inhaled volume is more important for capsule DPIs because the dose needs to be emptied from the capsule during the inhalation.6 Moreover, a dispensed dose does not equate to a delivered (or administered) dose. Delivery also requires the volume of therapy leaving the device to reach its target\u2014the lungs\u2014requiring appropriate breath control, achievement of which varies substantially be- tween different devices and device types (eg, slow vs sharp; breath-hold). As such, even when patients are accepting of their treat- ment, and complicit in its initiation, their ability to imple- ment the prescribed regimen successfully (which has inherent implications for treatment persistence) is dependent on their mastery of the speci\ufb01c inhaler-handling requirements (device positioning/priming, actuation coordination, inspiratory \ufb02ow rate, and breath control) of their prescribed device(s). The situation is further complicated by the common use of different inhaler device types for reliever and preventer ther- apies, requiring patients to master (and maintain mastery of) multiple techniques.6 Inadequate inhaler instruction and poor inhaler technique represent one of the key determinants of asthma medication adherence identi\ufb01ed by the Assessment of the Safety in LABAs in Asthma in Routine C", "r (and maintain mastery of) multiple techniques.6 Inadequate inhaler instruction and poor inhaler technique represent one of the key determinants of asthma medication adherence identi\ufb01ed by the Assessment of the Safety in LABAs in Asthma in Routine Care by combining Health-care databases and direct patient follow up (ASTRO-LAB) through its exten- sive review of the asthma adherence literature.7 This article considers the implications of mode of delivery of asthma and COPD therapy on medication adherence (and possible out- comes), in particular the challenges medication inhalation poses to successful implementation of treatment. A number of possible approaches to identifying and addressing inhaler device errors are also suggested. INHALED THERAPY\u2014\u201cTRYING, BUT FAILING\u201d The Ascertaining Barriers to Compliance taxonomy for medication adherence was commissioned by the European Union to standardize adherence-related terminology for clinical and research use.8 It proposes a transparent nomenclature that subdivides the traditional singular overarching research concept of \u201cadherence to medication\u201d into 3 distinct elements, specif- ically medication (1) initiation, (2) implementation, and (3) persistence. The subdivision summarizes the sequence of events within the medication process that have to occur for patients to take their prescribed medication(s) successfully and consistently (see Figure 1).8 Each element of the adherence pathway may potentially be affected by prescribed mode of therapy delivery. Treatment initiation Although it is often assumed that patients (at least) commence therapy as prescribed, a community-based study of initiation rates of chronic disease medications found that 28% of pre- scriptions issued to adults for new chronic disease medications were never d", "t is often assumed that patients (at least) commence therapy as prescribed, a community-based study of initiation rates of chronic disease medications found that 28% of pre- scriptions issued to adults for new chronic disease medications were never dispensed and approximately one-quarter of patients prescribed new asthma therapy failed to collect their \ufb01rst prescription.9 J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT VOLUME 4, NUMBER 5 BRAIDO ET AL 825", "In the routine care management of asthma and COPD, treatment initiation can be affected by a range of psychological and practical barriers, among them denial of diagnosis, disease awareness, lack of trust in health care professionals, medication fears, cognitive ability, affordability, and access to therapy.10-12 In the context of asthma and COPD, mode of therapy delivery can introduce an additional obstacle. Inhaled therapies are the backbone of asthma and COPD management, but there can be substantial stigma around the use of medication inhalers, particularly in certain age and cultural groups. Inhaler stigmas can deter initiation in some and (if collected) subsequent implementation and persistence in others.13 The recent REcog- nise Asthma and LInk to Symptoms and Experience (REALISE) Asia study, which assessed patients\u2019 perception of asthma control and attitudes toward treatment in a multinational Asian popu- lation, found that approximately half of all patients agreed with statements that having inhalers was \u201cembarrassing\u201d or \u201ca nuisance.\u201d Patients with uncontrolled asthma, in particular, felt that it was an embarrassment (62.0%) or a nuisance (52.2%) to use or even carry (56.7%) an inhaler in public, representing real psychosocial barriers to initiation (and subsequent implementa- tion and persistence) of inhaled therapy (see Table I). Treatment implementation and persistence Although treatment implementation and persistence are 2 distinct concepts\u2014the \ufb01rst relating to the longitudinal accu- racy of administration of the prescribed dosing regimen over time and second to the event of therapy discontinuation\u2014these are closely linked when considering the potential implications of therapeutic delivery approach in asthma and COPD.

The more challenging the patients \ufb01nd the mode of delivery of their maintenance therapy, the greater their potential barriers to suc- cessful implementation (administration and successful delivery) and, in turn, the greater the potential for diminished treatment outcomes.14,15 Inhaled medication. When it comes to the management of asthma and COPD, the primary mode of medication delivery is via inhalation. Therefore, in considering successful medication adherence in a holistic way, this requires patients not only to initiate and persist with their prescribed therapy but also to implement it successfully: at the appropriate dose and dosing frequency. This necessitates an understanding of the medication prescribed and the ability to use the inhaled medication correctly. The REALISE Asia study13 revealed a distinct lack of understanding of the details and requirements of their treatment regimen: a fundamental necessity to successful implementation and an obvious barrier to successful medication management. More than half (53%) of REALISE Asia patients were aware of the need to use con-troller inhaler regularly to help manage their asthma, but when asked about their controller inhalers only 20% of the patients were able to identify them correctly (31% iden- ti\ufb01ed them incorrectly, and the rest did not know). Of those who answered correctly, only 30% reported daily use of their controller inhalers.

To compound the problem, despite continual inhaler redesign and re\ufb01nement, incorrect (and inadequate) inhalation technique persists,16-19 resulting in suboptimal medication implementation and compromised asthma and COPD treatment outcomes.20 In a review of 21 studies of pMDI use, the prevalence of poor inhaler technique ranged from 14% to 90% (with an average of 50%).21 Furthermore, the use of multiple inhaler devices in an individual patient has been shown to be associated with a higher prevalence of errors than the use of single devices.22 The international Implementing \u201cHelping Asthma in Real People\u201d (iHARP) initiative is the largest evaluation of routine care inhaler technique conducted in asthma to date. A total of 5000 structured inhaler technique assessments were undertaken in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma receiving \ufb01xed-dose combination ICS and long-acting beta-agonist therapy across 8 participating countries (the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Norway, Australia, and the Netherlands).23 The structured inhaler technique assessment was part of a wider iHARP asthma review that included patient questionnaires, life- style and current asthma control assessments (including factors that may have an impact on asthma control), and a structured inhaler FIGURE 1.

Frequency and inhalation errors were categorized for patients prescribed \ufb01xed-dose combinations of a bronchodilator and ICS therapies, formulated in a Diskus or Turbohaler, or pMDI (\ufb02uticasone propionateand salmeterolcombination; Seretide)with or without a spacer. Analysis of the data revealed a high prevalence (90%)ofinhaler techniqueerrors(\u00031 error)acrossalldevices: 84% for their Diskus, 91% for Turbohaler, 92% for pMDI, and 91% for the pMDI when used with a spacer. More than 20% of the patients demonstrated at least 4 errors when using their controller inhalers.24 The 12 most common errors recorded among Diskus users in the iHARP initiative are summarized in Table II. Absence of an inhaler technique review in the previous year was identi\ufb01ed as a predictor of error performance among Diskus users, as were asthma-related hospitalization in the previous year, obesity, poor asthma control the previous 4 weeks, and female sex.25 Further to this lies a potentially more complex relationship and the clinical signi\ufb01cance of inhaler technique errors should not be overlooked. In asthma, research suggests that higher patient satisfaction with their asthma inhaler device is a signi\ufb01- cant predictor of more favorable clinical outcomes.26 In a pro- spective patient and physician survey conducted to evaluate the relationships between asthma outcomes, patient-reported satis- faction with their inhaler device, and physician-reported adher- ence, more favorable clinical outcomes were signi\ufb01cantly associated with greater inhaler satisfaction (P \u00bc .002) and higher medication adherence (P \u00bc .049).

Attributes associated with device satisfaction in the study included patient perceptions of consistency in the amount of drug delivery to the lungs, ease of use, and feedback about the number of remaining doses. A similar association between inhaler satisfaction, medication implementation, and clinical outcomes has also been observed in COPD.27 A multinational real-world survey of clinicians (res- piratory specialists and primary care physicians) and patients with COPD (n \u00bc 1443) found that patients\u2019 overall satisfaction with their maintenance inhaler was signi\ufb01cantly associated with their medication implementation (as assessed by their physicians). Patient-reported ease of inhaler use was among the factors that in\ufb02uenced patients\u2019 satisfaction with their maintenance therapy delivery device. Signi\ufb01cant associations were observed between increasing treatment compliance and fewer exacerbations and hospitalizations. A direct association between inhaler satisfaction and fewer exacerbations was also reported.26 These results are consistent with research that suggests that motivation for good inhaler technique may be a key factor in long-term correct use.15 Inhaler device \u201cswitching\u201d. With the recent and future expiration of patent protections for several longstanding ICS and bronchodilator therapies has come the development of bio- equivalent, generic inhaled drugs and the potential for estab- lished users of branded inhaled drugs to be switched to generic formulations. Switching can lead to the use of new and/or multiple inhalers and, consequently, new challenges and barriers to effective dose administration and medication implementa- tion.28-30 S", "ers of branded inhaled drugs to be switched to generic formulations. Switching can lead to the use of new and/or multiple inhalers and, consequently, new challenges and barriers to effective dose administration and medication implementa- tion.28-30 Such possibilities will need to be countered by thoughtful training, retraining, and ongoing education to avoid loss of disease control and stability and recognition that switching asthma therapy without an accompanying consultation has been shown to lead to worsening asthma outcomes.31 Inhaler device \u201cmixing\u201d. Because many patients with asthma and/or COPD are prescribed both inhaled reliever therapy (ie, short-term bronchodilators for symptom relief) and inhaled maintenance therapy (eg, corticosteroids and/or bron- chodilators for long-term risk management), the implications of \u201cdevice mixing\u201d (ie, the prescription of >1 inhaler device type for a single patient) must be considered.

Indeed, a negative asso- ciation has been shown between maintenance inhaler number and patients\u2019 medication implementation (patients prescribed \u00032 maintenance inhaler devices have been shown to be 34% less likely to be \u201cadherent\u201d and to have a 40% higher treatment discontinuation rate than are patients taking a single long-acting inhaled drug),32 and use of mixed/different inhaler device types for maintenance and reliever therapies is associated with higher rates of severe exacerbations and lower odds of achieving asthma control in patients with asthma initiating ICS therapy.33 To mitigate against such challenges in the future, new gen- erations of devices aim to limit the number of inhaler maneuvers necessary and try to support successful administration through visual and auditory feedback systems. In addition, several device manufacturers have developed an inhaler device that will serve as a standard \u201cplatform\u201d for all the drugs commercialized by the company, enabling \ufb02exibility in terms of drug, and drug dosage, while retaining a standardized inhaler tool across the inhaled therapy portfolio. However, the availability of reliever therapies (eg, salbutamol) in these devices remains limited owing to a lack of commercial viability resulting from regulation of short-acting beta-agonist drug costs.

The challenges patients face in successfully implementing inhaled therapy can be inferred from the results of Price et al\u2019s14 pragmatic single-blind randomized controlled trial and economic evaluation of the use of leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) in primary care at steps 2 and 3 of the national asthma guidelines (the ELEVATE study, a pragmatic single-blind randomized controlled trial and economic evaluation of the use of leukotriene receptor antagonists in primary care at steps 2 and 3 of the national asthma guidelines). At the primary 2-month outcome period, initiation of LTRAs was equivalent to guideline-recommended ICS therapy in terms of the primary outcome Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire. By the 2- year secondary outcome period, although true equivalence was not shown, no signi\ufb01cant differences were found between LTRAs and ICS for any of the primary or secondary outcome measures. One of the likely reasons the ELEVATE authors offered for the equivalence \ufb01nding was the higher rate of adherence to LTRA compared with ICS therapy (median adherence rates of 65% and 41%, respectively). Although ICS is more ef\ufb01cacious than LTRA therapy when implemented optimally in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) environment,14 the ELEVATE data suggest that starting anti-in\ufb02ammatory therapy as LTRA is noninferior to ICS when initiated with a less onerous ecology of care than used in classical RCTs. As such, LTRA could be considered as a possible alternative to initiating anti-in\ufb02ammatory therapy as ICS in patients with asthma, particularly in those with a noted preference for oral over inhaled therapy and/or who struggle to master inhaler device technique.

Indeed, in a questionnaire-based assessment of dosing frequency prevalence in 3731 patients with asthma and 2138 patients with COPD, approximately half the patients in each cohort indicated a preference for once-daily controller therapy.36 Across both asthma and COPD cohorts, preference for once- daily controller medication was signi\ufb01cantly associated with poor implementation and higher medication-related concerns. Yet the drivers for patient preference appeared to vary between conditions, with preference for once-daily therapy in patients with asthma being associated with good control and low self- perceived controller medication need while, in contrast, prefer- ence among patients with COPD was associated with high self- perceived need for controller medication. The study \ufb01ndings suggest that there are differences between people with asthma and those with COPD and, moreover, that inherent differences in the nature of asthma and COPD may in\ufb02uence patient perceptions (and behaviors) toward their pre- scribed therapies.

However, COPD symptoms are constant, progressive, and often debili- tating. Furthermore, patients with COPD tend to have multiple comorbidities, which may mean that they are already on a complex cocktail of drugs and are keen to simplify their treat- ment regimen, where possible. The limited evidence of the effect of dosing regimen on res- piratory medication adherence suggests that once-daily admin- istration may be associated with better implementation than twice-daily therapy in asthma.35 This is consistent with obser- vations in other chronic conditions, such as diabetes and HIV.37 Such \ufb01ndings suggest the importance of understanding patients\u2019 beliefs about their treatment\u2014in particular their self-perceived necessity and concerns about therapy\u2014in selecting the opti- mum management approach (including controller therapy and dosing regimen) so as to optimize treatment initiation, imple- mentation, and discontinuation. ROLE OF THE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL Patients\u2019 medication beliefs and preferences are associated with their adherence to asthma and COPD therapies38-40 and treatment outcomes depend not only on the availability of medications but also on their appropriate prescribing and suc- cessful administration. Poor adherence to asthma and COPD controller medications is associated with higher rates of exacer- bations and impaired quality of life, resulting in increased health care costs from unnecessary escalations in therapy and avoidable hospitalizations.41-44 Many patients choose not to take their medication because they perceive it to be unnecessary or because they are concerned about potential adverse effects. These concerns are limited not only to the experience of local ICS-related adverse effects but also to mor", "s choose not to take their medication because they perceive it to be unnecessary or because they are concerned about potential adverse effects. These concerns are limited not only to the experience of local ICS-related adverse effects but also to more abstract concerns about future medication dependency. Previous work has reported a direct relationship between patients\u2019 beliefs about ICS (their need for it and related concerns) and re\ufb01ll-based ICS implementation.40 Similarly, the odds of ICS implementation have been shown to be higher among patients who felt that using ICS when asymptomatic was important and in patients con\ufb01dent in using their controller therapy, but lower in those who reported concerns about adverse effects of ICS or who felt that their regimen was hard to follow.34 Similarly, in patients with COPD, patients\u2019 conviction of the importance of treatment is reported to have a signi\ufb01cant positive in\ufb02uence on adherence.45 The health care practitioner has an instrumental role to play in eliciting and addressing patients\u2019 attitudes and beliefs about therapy in such a way as to individualize treatment choice and tailor education appropriately with a view to optimizing adher- ence (see article by van Boven et al46 in this issue). Despite best efforts, time and resource restrictions may result in patients and/ or their caregivers not feeling that they receive all the information they feel they need about their condition and prescribed medi- cations, with the potential for patient disenfranchisement early in the medication adherence pathway.47 The concept of patient-centered care is highlighted by the case study described in Figure 2, which summarizes the characteristics of a patient referred to a specialist asthma service in the Netherlands and illustrates how la", "tion adherence pathway.47 The concept of patient-centered care is highlighted by the case study described in Figure 2, which summarizes the characteristics of a patient referred to a specialist asthma service in the Netherlands and illustrates how lack of patient engagement and critical interrogation of patient details by primary care clinicians can result in escalation of patients\u2019 care and unnecessary use of available health care resources. The 52-year-old female patient has asthma and bronchitis (but COPD is not proven) with very poor Medical Research Council dyspnea, Asthma Control Questionnaire, and Clinical COPD Questionnaire scores of 5, 4.8, and 4.8, respectively. Before presentation at the severe asthma service, she had been prescribed short-acting broncho- dilator therapy, ICS, and different long-acting bronchodilator therapies. Although her spirometry readings were also poor, she showed good reversibility and, when asked, she admitted to only occasional use of her medications. Moreover, when assessed she performed 4 inhalation technique errors. A lack of \u201cclinical inertia\u201d within the primary care setting had resulted in an esca- lation of bronchodilator therapy from short- to long-acting, perhaps re\ufb02ecting the possible presence of the asthma-COPD overlap syndrome, but overlooking the key issue of poor implementation, with respect to both prescribed treatment fre- quency and effectiveness of inhaler administration. TOWARD OPTIMIZED ADHERENCE TO RESPIRATORY MEDICATION Asthma and COPD guidelines underline the importance of correct inhaler technique training and frequent inhaler technique checks.1,2,48 Yet assessment of inhaler technique knowledge among health care professionals reveals limited expertise, with 39% to 85% of nurses, doctors, and respiratory therap", "nce of correct inhaler technique training and frequent inhaler technique checks.1,2,48 Yet assessment of inhaler technique knowledge among health care professionals reveals limited expertise, with 39% to 85% of nurses, doctors, and respiratory therapists unable to demonstrate and brief patients in the proper use of their devices.49-51 In an assessment of inhaler technique in health care professionals working on a respiratory ward of a major metro- politan hospital in Australia (and the subsequent impact of training on their pro\ufb01ciency), not 1 of the 25 health care pro- fessional (pharmacists, n \u00bc 11; nurses, n \u00bc 16) demonstrated correct inhaler technique before training.52 The challenge of correct inhaler training by health care professionals is also likely exacerbated by time constraints in clinical practice: it has been reported that 1 in every 4 patients does not receive any verbal instruction and nearly 1 in 2 receives less than 10 minutes of inhaler training.51 Ability to successfully administer prescribed therapy has a direct effect not only on medication implementation but also on perceived treatment bene\ufb01t and patients\u2019 willingness to persist with therapy. The importance of optimizing therapy delivery is also stressed in the World Allergy Organization and International Association of Asthmology (INTERASMA) \u201cManifesto on adherence to asthma treatment in respiratory allergy\u201d (also endorsed by Allergic Rhinitis and Its Impact on Asthma and the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network).53 The mani- festo recommends that adherence be prioritized within patient education and advises that while adherence is considered a \u201cmoral responsibility\u201d of the patient, health care professionals should be empathetic rather than condemnatory and provide patients with support and ", "t adherence be prioritized within patient education and advises that while adherence is considered a \u201cmoral responsibility\u201d of the patient, health care professionals should be empathetic rather than condemnatory and provide patients with support and education.

There remain many related research needs that warrant further explo- ration in well-designed studies (particularly real-life studies) targeted at speci\ufb01c steps of the temporal adherence pathway and using appropriate research methods. Among the future needs identi\ufb01ed by Price et al3 for asthma were the gaps in inhaler education and knowledge; the health economic and clinical outcome evaluations associated with inhaler technique; and the impact of cultural beliefs on inhaler use. Additional research needs relating to asthma and COPD medication delivery and adherence, discussed or implied within this review, are proposed in Figure 3. At their core is the need for a more holistic and integrated approach to treatment optimization that combines generic device education delivered with more targeted interventions to promote overall quality use of medications. To achieve this, there is a need for better understanding of how adherence and inhaler technique are conceptually related (whether they are distinct or should be combined as part of \u201cquality use of medications\u201d approach); a need to develop more generic educational interventions that transcend device-speci\ufb01c challenges, device switching, and combination use, and a need to improve understanding of distinct adherence and technique behaviors within key patient subgroups (eg, pediatrics, adoles- cents, adults, and elderly) and at different disease stages in order to inform the development of more targeted interventions.

CONCLUSIONS The ef\ufb01cacy of therapies for asthma and COPD has been repeatedly demonstrated in the RCT setting, yet both conditions are often inadequately managed in everyday routine care.1,2 The difference in ef\ufb01cacy and effectiveness pro\ufb01les of respiratory therapies results from strict RCT design. These studies exclude many of the real-life factors that interact with idealized ef\ufb01cacy when therapies are used in the routine care environment, such as comorbid conditions (eg, diabetes, gastroesophageal re\ufb02ux, and cardiovascular disease), wide ranging lifestyle factors (eg, smoking and trigger exposures), and varying levels of treatment adherence. RCTs may positively bias adherence to therapy through their highly interventional nature, leading to possible \u201cwhite coat adherence\u201d (improved patient adherence to treatment around clinic visits),54 Hawthorne effects,55 and training and retraining of effective technique in the case of inhaled therapies. As inhaled therapies form the backbone of the therapeutic management of asthma and COPD, it is important to prescribe an inhaler that the patient can and will use.6 The identi\ufb01cation of patients\u2019 attitudes (and potential concerns) to inhalers should also be explored to ensure there are no obvious barriers to initiation and use of the prescribed therapy. Thereafter, it is crucial that patients are instructed as to the correct use of their inhalers and that their technique is regularly checked and corrected/retrained, as required. Failure to do so will result in suboptimal implementation (failure to receive the prescribed dose at the frequency intended), suboptimal treatment outcomes, and potential early discontinuatio", "is regularly checked and corrected/retrained, as required. Failure to do so will result in suboptimal implementation (failure to receive the prescribed dose at the frequency intended), suboptimal treatment outcomes, and potential early discontinuation. Inhaler technique is not always well understood by health care professionals, but clinicians should aim to have knowledge of several inhaler devices (and device types) so that they can tailor device selection to the individual needs, preferences, and capa- bilities of their patients.6 The list of common Diskus errors identi\ufb01ed by the iHARP investigators24 can be used by practicing clinicians as an aide memoire (or reference checklist) when con- ducting relevant inhaler technique assessments. Identi\ufb01cation of suboptimal inhaler use should prompt retraining and/or a dis- cussion with the patients as to their perceived challenges using their device and alternative treatment options that may be more suitable. Alternatives should include consideration of simpli\ufb01- cation of treatment regimen (such as use of same type inhalers for reliever and controller medications; move to combination ther- apies to reduce the number of different inhalers being used; switching to once-daily therapies) or even possible use of oral therapies, in line with guideline recommendations.1,2 To optimize adherence to therapy (initiation, implementation, and persistence), treatment decisions should be conducted in collaboration with the patient and should take into consideration their lifestyle factors (eg, work patterns/shifts that may be a barrier to frequent dosing), demographic characteristics (eg, age; see article by Costello et al56 in this issue), and clinical factors (eg, comorbidities and potentially complex polypharmacy regi- mens).

Recent advancements in molecular pharmacology and a deepened understanding of disease mechanisms have emphasized the need to precisely target speci\ufb01c cells responsible for disease onset and progression to prevent side effects and minimize systemic exposure. Drug delivery (DD) involves the strategies, formula- tions, technologies, and procedures employed to transport a pharmaceutical substance within the body of both humans and animals to produce the intended therapeutic outcome. The most frequently used delivery methods include topical (applied to the skin), transmucosal (such as nasal, buccal, sublingual, vaginal, ocular, and rectal), and inhalation routes. Traditional dosage forms release the drug rapidly, which can lead to variations in blood drug levels depending on the form of dosage. Current drug delivery systems (DDS) leverage cutting-edge technology to expedite the delivery of drugs systemically to speci\ufb01c target sites, thereby maximizing therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy while minimizing unintended accumulation in the body. Conse- quently, they play a pivotal role in disease management and treatment. Modern DDS present distinct advantages over conventional delivery systems, owing to their superior performance, automation, precision, and effectiveness. Utilizing nanomaterials or small-scale devices with multifunctional components, these systems are characterized by biocompatibility, biodegradability, and high viscoelasticity, resulting in pro- longed circulating half-lives.

It encompasses a variety of techniques and technologies aimed at safely and effectively transporting drugs to their intended site of action within the body. This can include methods such as oral ingestion, injections, patches, or controlled-release formulations. The primary goal of drug delivery is to optimize the ef\ufb01cacy, safety, Abhishek Pathak and Satya Pal Singh (eds.), Next-Generation Drug Delivery Systems, Methods in Pharmacology and Toxicology, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-4554-3_1, \u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025 1", "and patient compliance of pharmaceutical treatments. Utilizing an advanced drug delivery system (ADDS) can rejuvenate an existing drug molecule, breathing new life into its therapeutic potential [1]. The slow but steady enhancement in effectively treating severe illnesses underscores a growing necessity for a multidisciplinary approach to delivering medications to speci\ufb01c tissues. The consti- tuents of the medication determine its physicochemical character- istics and are accountable for the alterations it induces in the body when ingested. The progress in pharmacology and pharmacokinet- ics has underscored the signi\ufb01cance of drug release in determining therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy, leading to the emergence of the controlled release concept. The approval of controlled-release formulations of drugs initially occurred in the 1950s, sparking notable interest because of their considerable advantages over traditional medica- tions (Table 1). These formulations release drugs at a predeter- mined rate and duration. Moreover, controlled drug delivery systems remain unaffected by physiological conditions, allowing them to sustain drug release for extended periods ranging from days to years (Fig. 1) [2]. Traditional approaches are constrained by factors such as the inadequate solubility of drugs, lack of speci\ufb01city, and undesirable release characteristics. 2 Santanu Pal et al.

Fifth generation Long-term delivery systems (6\u201312 months) Nanorobots, gene therapy, biologicals Novel drug delivery systems (NDDS) offer solutions to com- mon issues associated with traditional dosage forms, including high dosage with low availability, instability, the \ufb01rst-pass effect, \ufb02uctu- ating plasma drug levels, and rapid release of medicinal products. Through improved performance, protection, patient compliance, and extended product shelf life, NDDS aims to alleviate these problems. Nanoparticles \ufb01nd applications across various \ufb01elds and are produced through diverse processes. Currently, 95% of experi- mental drugs exhibit inadequate pharmacokinetic and", "biopharmaceutical properties. As a result, it\u2019s imperative to estab- lish medication distribution schemes that speci\ufb01cally target affected sites without causing harm to healthy tissues. This approach aims to disperse therapeutic drug molecules effectively, reducing required dosage levels and enhancing therapeutic effectiveness and safety pro\ufb01les in novel therapies [3]. The origins of modern drug delivery technology trace back to 1952 when the Spansule\u00ae sustained- release capsule technology was introduced. This innovation allows for the gradual release of a drug over 12 hours following oral administration, achieved by an initial immediate dose followed by a gradual release of the remaining medication. Before the 1980s, oral and transdermal formulations were the primary methods for delivering small-molecule drugs, providing therapeutic effects last- ing up to 24 hours. However, the landscape changed with the introduction of Lupron Depot\u00ae in 1989, marking the emergence of long-acting injectable and implantable formulations. These innovations extended drug delivery durations from days to months, and in some cases, even years. Notably, these advancements facili- tated the long-term delivery of peptide and protein drugs, albeit restricted to parenteral administration [4]. The advent of the \ufb01rst PEGylated protein, Adagen\u00ae, in 1990 heralded the onset of the PEGylation era. This led to the development of Doxil\u00ae (doxorubi- cin in PEGylated liposome) in 1995, Movantik\u00ae (PEGylated naloxone\u2014naloxegol) in 2014, and Onpattro\u00ae (Patisiran\u2014 siRNA in PEGylated lipid nanoparticle) in 2018 [4].

While these plants offered bene\ufb01ts, they lacked uniformity, consis- tency, and precision in drug delivery. Before the adoption of con- trolled drug delivery methods, pharmaceuticals were typically manufactured and preserved in pill or capsule forms. Upon inges- tion, these formulations dissolved upon contact with gastrointesti- nal \ufb02uids passed through the intestinal wall and were subsequently absorbed into the bloodstream via blood capillaries. However, during this period, there was no capability to regulate the kinetics of drug release. Several systems incorporating polymers were avail- able, with waxes frequently included alongside drugs to prolong their mechanisms of action or enhance speci\ufb01c features such as targeting particular sites. The conventional drug delivery system consists of cream, ointment, paste, tablets, capsules, pills, solution, mixture, tinctures, emulsion, suspension, granules, powders, snuffs, inhalations, aerosols, liniments, lotions, paints, and suppo- sitories, etc. (Fig. 2). Creams are semi-solid dosage forms known for their soft tex- ture and ease of spreading. They typically consist of over 20% water and volatile substances, with less than 50% hydrocarbons like waxes or polyols serving as the base for the drugs. Cream bases are emulsions categorized into two types: oil-in-water (O/W) creams Fig. 2 Schematic diagram outlining the available conventional dosage forms", " oil-in-water (O/W) creams Fig. 2 Schematic diagram outlining the available conventional dosage forms", "and water-in-oil (W/O) creams. Oil-in-water (O/W) creams are composed of tiny oil globules dispersed within a continuous aque- ous phase, stabilized by surfactants. Introduction to Drug Delivery System: Past, Present, and Future Perspectives 5 Ointments are semi-solid formulations primarily composed of oil-based substances, with the base typically being anhydrous and not mixing with skin secretions. They contain less than 20% water and volatile substances, with over 50% hydrocarbons (such as waxes or polyols) serving as the vehicle. This composition results in oint- ments having a prolonged retention time but lower spreadability. Paste is essentially an ointment with a higher concentration of insoluble solids incorporated. The addition of a signi\ufb01cant amount of particulate matter leads to increased stiffness of the formulation. Compared to ointments, pastes exhibit reduced permeability, less risk of maceration, and lower heat. Upon application to the skin, pastes form an effective protective barrier. Tablets are a solid form of medication that is produced through compression and wet/dry granulation, resulting in various shapes such as round, oval, or square. To facilitate effective tableting, excipients like binders, glidants, and lubricants are commonly included. Additionally, disintegrants are added to promote the rapid breakdown of tablets within the digestive system. Capsules are another form of a solid dosage in which the drug ingredients are enclosed within a soluble shell. Capsules serve to conceal the unpleasant taste of their contents and typically exhibit limited interaction between the drug and excipients. There are two main types of capsules: Hard-shelled capsules, primarily utilized for encapsulating dry, powdered components, and soft-shelled cap- sules, ma", "e of their contents and typically exhibit limited interaction between the drug and excipients. There are two main types of capsules: Hard-shelled capsules, primarily utilized for encapsulating dry, powdered components, and soft-shelled cap- sules, mainly employed for hydrophobic drugs and oily active sub- stances that are either suspended or dissolved in oil. Pills are solid single-dose forms created by compressing active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) together with adhesives and other additives into rounded masses intended for oral administration. A suppository is a small, rounded, or cone-shaped semi-solid medication form inserted into a bodily opening such as the rectum or vagina. It dissolves or melts within the body to release the drug, providing either local or systemic therapeutic effects. Suppositories typically consist of natural fats like cocoa butter or synthetic com- pounds like polyethylene glycol (Carbowax), with glycerol serving as a primary excipient. They are speci\ufb01cally designed for rectal insertion and offer a rapid onset of action due to the highly vascu- larized nature of the rectum. Additionally, they bypass the hepatic \ufb01rst-pass metabolism. Oral solutions are clear liquid formulations intended for oral administration, consisting of one or more active ingredients dis- solved in an appropriate solvent system. Oral emulsions are liquid formulations designed for oral administration, featuring a biphasic composition where the drug is contained within an oil-in-water", "emulsion, present in either single or dual phases. Oral suspensions are liquid dosage forms intended for oral administration, consisting of one or more active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) suspended within a suitable solvent. Although they tend to settle over time, they can be easily redispersed by shaking to achieve a uniform suspension. This suspension remains stable enough to ensure accu- rate dosing. Syrup refers to a concentrated solution of sugar, typi- cally sucrose, in water, within which active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are dissolved. Flavored syrups are particularly useful for masking the unpleasant taste of medications. An elixir is a clear liquid intended for oral administration, primarily used for delivering potent or nauseating drugs by incorporating pleasant \ufb02avors. The formulation includes a signi\ufb01cant proportion of etha- nol or sucrose as the vehicle, along with antimicrobial preservatives to improve stability. 6 Santanu Pal et al. In 1951, Lipowski pioneered a patented oral sustained-release formulation. He coated pills with enteric polymers (such as beads), layering the drug and coating alternately. This method resulted in a slow, consistent, and periodic release of the drug [2]. In 1955, Jatzkewitz reported the \ufb01rst therapeutic nanoparticle by preparing the initial polymer-drug conjugate [2]. Following 1970, there was a rapid development of site-speci\ufb01c drug delivery systems, with continuous updates to strategies, encompassing advancements such as liposomes (including immunoliposomes and magnetolipo- somes), nanoparticles (including magnetic nanoparticles and poly- meric nanoparticles), sophisticated polymers (such as dendrimers), and viral vectors [5]. 3 Recent Drug Delivery Systems In recent years, considerable advancements have been ac", "tolipo- somes), nanoparticles (including magnetic nanoparticles and poly- meric nanoparticles), sophisticated polymers (such as dendrimers), and viral vectors [5]. 3 Recent Drug Delivery Systems In recent years, considerable advancements have been achieved in the development of drug delivery systems utilizing organic, inor- ganic, and hybrid nanoparticles as carriers for targeted drug deliv- ery, especially in chemotherapy (Fig. 3). These modern drug delivery systems are designed with enhanced characteristics such as reduced particle size, improved permeability, enhanced solubil- ity, ef\ufb01cacy, precise targeting, stability, decreased toxicity, and pro- longed release. A novel drug delivery system (NDDS) encompasses methods, formulations, technologies, and systems designed to effectively transport a pharmaceutical substance within the body, ensuring its safe delivery to achieve the intended therapeutic out- comes [6]. Novel drug delivery systems encompass both physical and biochemical mechanisms. Physical mechanisms, known as con- trolled drug delivery systems, involve processes such as osmosis, diffusion, erosion, dissolution, and electron transport. Biochemical mechanisms consist of monoclonal antibodies, gene therapy, vector systems, polymer-drug conjugates, and liposomes. Drug carriers", "encompass a variety of options including soluble polymers, micro- particles constructed from insoluble or biodegradable natural and synthetic polymers, microcapsules, cells, cell ghosts, lipoproteins, liposomes, and micelles. These carriers can be designed to degrade slowly, respond to stimuli such as pH or temperature changes, and even be targeted by attaching speci\ufb01c antibodies against character- istic components of the desired area within the body. Introduction to Drug Delivery System: Past, Present, and Future Perspectives 7 Fig. 3 Various recent drug delivery systems designed for diverse therapeutic objectives 4 Drug Delivery via Carriers Carriers play a crucial role in achieving targeted drug delivery by serving as essential molecules or systems necessary for effectively transporting the loaded drug to speci\ufb01c sites within the body. These engineered vectors are designed to retain the drug either through encapsulation or by using spacer molecules, and subsequently transport or deliver it to the vicinity of the target cell. Several drug delivery systems rely on carriers, including microspheres and microcapsules, nanoparticles, monoclonal antibodies, prodrugs, resealed erythrocytes, arti\ufb01cial cells, neutrophils, and vesicular carriers. In recent times, vesicles have emerged as the preferred method for drug delivery. Lipid vesicles have proven to be valuable tools in", "immunology, membrane biology, diagnostic methods, and more recently, genetic engineering. Vesicles are instrumental in modeling biological membranes and facilitating the transport and targeted delivery of active agents. Vesicular drug delivery systems include phytosomes, aquasomes, liposomes, sphinosomes, transferosomes, niosomes, ethosomes, and phytosomes (Table 2). 8 Santanu Pal et al. Table 2 Variations among nanosomal vesicular carriers are outlined [17] Sl. No. Nanosome Main component Uses Special properties 1. Niosomes Cholesterol, charge-inducing substances, nonionic surfactants Carrier of lipophilic and amphiphilic drugs Stable, no need for special storage or preparation 2. Liposomes Phospholipids dispersed in aqueous solution Used in targeted oral, topical, and pulmonary DD Unstable, needs special storage and preparation 3. Transferosomes Surfactants, a little alcohol, dye, and phosphatidylcholine in buffer solution Penetrate deeper epidermis layers, used for transdermal delivery Ultra \ufb02exible and deformable vesicles 4. Ethosomes High concentration of alcohol, phospholipid, water, cholesterol, dye Controlled transdermal delivery Soft and novel vesicles Phytosomes represent a novel drug delivery system where the hydrophilic bioactive components of herbs are encapsulated and surrounded by phospholipids. This complex resembles a miniature cell, leading to improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties compared to traditional herbal extracts, ultimately resulting in enhanced bioavailability. The binding of botanical extracts with phospholipids enhances their absorption in the intes- tinal tract, thereby increasing their bioavailability. Aquasomes represent a recent advancement in delivery systems designed for transporting bioactive molecules, including pep", "nical extracts with phospholipids enhances their absorption in the intes- tinal tract, thereby increasing their bioavailability. Aquasomes represent a recent advancement in delivery systems designed for transporting bioactive molecules, including peptides, proteins, hormones, antigens, and genes, to speci\ufb01c targeted sites. These spherical structures typically range from 60 to 300 nan- ometers in size. Unlike conventional nanoparticles, aquasomes are three-layered self-assembled structures. They consist of a solid nanocrystalline core surrounded by an oligomeric \ufb01lm, onto which biochemically active molecules can be adsorbed with or without modi\ufb01cation. These structures form through non-covalent and ionic bonds. The solid core provides structural stability, while the carbohydrate coating prevents dehydration and stabilizes the bioactive molecules. Aquasomes have demonstrated ef\ufb01cacy in delivering substances such as insulin, hemoglobin, and enzymes like serration peptidase.", "Introduction to Drug Delivery System: Past, Present, and Future Perspectives 9 Liposomes, derived from the term \u201clipid body,\u201d are micro- scopic spherical vesicles composed of one or more concentric lipid bilayers, with water or aqueous buffer compartments in between, and diameters ranging from 25 nm to 10,000 nm. These structures form through the self-assembly of phospholipid molecules in an aqueous environment. Liposomes typically consist of one or more amphiphilic phospholipid bilayer membranes, also known as phos- pholipid vesicles, capable of encapsulating both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs. Hydrophilic drugs are enclosed within the aqueous center of the liposome, while the phospholipid membrane comprising the liposome\u2019s wall can accommodate hydrophobic agents. Sphingosomes can be described as vesicles with concentric, bilayer structures where an aqueous compartment is completely enclosed by a lipid bilayer primarily made up of natural or synthetic sphingolipids. These sphingosomes can be administered through various routes, including parenteral routes such as intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, and intra-arterial methods. Transfersomes represent a recent advancement in drug delivery systems and are a specialized form of liposomes. They consist of phosphatidylcholine along with an edge activator. These structures possess an extremely \ufb02exible membrane, enabling them to consis- tently deliver drugs either into or through the skin. The effective- ness of drug delivery using this system depends on the method of administration or application chosen. Transferosomes exhibit sig- ni\ufb01cantly greater elasticity and \ufb02exibility compared to conventional liposomal drug delivery systems. This enhanced \ufb02exibility facilitates ef\ufb01cient penetration of the skin, making transfe", "inistration or application chosen. Transferosomes exhibit sig- ni\ufb01cantly greater elasticity and \ufb02exibility compared to conventional liposomal drug delivery systems. This enhanced \ufb02exibility facilitates ef\ufb01cient penetration of the skin, making transferosomes a promising option for novel drug delivery systems. They are essen- tially highly adaptable and optimized mixed lipid complexes. Niosomes represent an innovative drug delivery approach where the medication is enclosed within a vesicle. These vesicles are constructed from a bilayer of non-ionic surface-active agents, giving rise to their name \u201cniosomes.\u201d Niosomes are characterized by their minute size, falling within the nanometric scale, making them microscopic. Ethosomes are liposomes containing ethanol. They serve as noninvasive carriers facilitating the penetration of drugs into deep skin layers or systemic circulation. Ethosomes are \ufb02exible vesicles designed to enhance the delivery of active agents. These vesicles have long been recognized for their signi\ufb01cance in cellular commu- nication and particle transport. Additionally, they enable the con- trol of drug release rates over extended periods, protecting the drug from immune responses or elimination systems. Consequently, they can maintain optimal drug concentrations for prolonged durations.", "10 Santanu Pal et al. 5 Recent Drug Delivery Systems 5.1 Red Blood Cell Membrane- Camou\ufb02aged Nanoparticles Drug Delivery System The inherent properties and biological importance of red blood cells (RBCs) make them an effective choice for concealing nano- particles and serving as a camou\ufb02age material. Due to their abun- dance as the most prevalent circulating cells in the body, red blood cells (RBCs) possess biocompatibility, biodegradability, and an extended circulating half-life, rendering them well suited as an optimal carrier for drug delivery. Numerous approaches have been devised to load therapeutic substances onto red blood cells (RBCs) while preserving their structural integrity and physiological functions. Coated nanoparticles are designed to imitate RBCs, allowing for prolonged systemic circulation upon injection and interaction with the surrounding environment. Sonication stands out as the predominant technique for producing RBC-camou\ufb02aged nanoparticles. Alternative methods for combining RBCs with nanoparticles include in-situ polymeriza- tion, micro\ufb02uidic electroporation, and extrusion. The utilization of RBCM-NP drug delivery systems holds great promise and pre- sents several advantages, primarily stemming from their minimal immunogenicity and capacity for sustaining prolonged systemic circulation, lasting up to 120 days. 5.2 Hyaluronic Acid- Based Drug Nanocarriers Drug Delivery Systems Hyaluronic acid represents a novel polymer suitable for crafting medication delivery systems. This linear macromolecular muco- polysaccharide consists of interconnected glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine saccharide units. It possesses attributes such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, and high viscoelasticity, and it can bind to speci\ufb01c cell surface receptors. Given", "polysaccharide consists of interconnected glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine saccharide units. It possesses attributes such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, and high viscoelasticity, and it can bind to speci\ufb01c cell surface receptors. Given its natural presence in eye tissue and its role in wound healing, utilizing hyaluronic acid as a carrier for ocular drug delivery seems logical, provided that it ensures consistent release of the incorporated pharmaceuticals. The use of active targeted hyaluronic acid (HA)-based drug nanocar- riers has signi\ufb01cantly enhanced drug distribution to cancer cells. Furthermore, lipid nanoparticles coated with appropriate HA have been engineered as biocompatible drug carriers, showing promising potential for targeted drug delivery to speci\ufb01c tissues while mitigating side effects on other tissues. Employing HA-based nanocarriers for cancers exhibiting elevated CD44 receptor expres- sion offers several advantages, including enhanced drug delivery, improved therapeutic effectiveness, heightened cytotoxicity, a nota- ble reduction in tumor growth, and considerable potential for targeted chemotherapy. 5.3 Hexagonal Boron Nitride Nanosheet Drug Delivery System Jedrzejczak-Silicka and her team have demonstrated the utility of hexagonal boron nitride (H-BN) in drug research and delivery systems. Their study revealed a decrease in the proliferation of", "MCF-7 cell line cultures compared to normal L929 cell lines when exposed to H-BN loaded with gold particles. The process involved exfoliating H-BN through chemical treatment using a modi\ufb01ed Hummers\u2019 method and sonication treatment, followed by functio- nalization with gold particles for analysis using the neutral red (NR) uptake assay. Introduction to Drug Delivery System: Past, Present, and Future Perspectives 11 5.4 Polymer-Lipid Hybrid Nanoparticles Drug Delivery System This hybrid system successfully meets various criteria including biocompatibility, long storage stability, sustained drug release, min- imal drug leakage, small particle size, and ef\ufb01cient encapsulation. Due to its effectiveness, this system is currently utilized for diverse therapeutic purposes and diagnostic applications. PLHNPs consist of three key components: a polymeric core capable of effectively encapsulating both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs due to its dual nature, resulting in sustained release; a lipid shell ensuring biocompatibility and high stability; and a lipid-polyethylene glycol (PEG) outer layer covered by a lipid shell, enhancing steric stability, preventing immune recognition, and prolonging circulation time. PLHNPs \ufb01nd wide-ranging applications in delivering various che- motherapeutic agents, and gene transfer (siRNA, DNA), as well as in photothermal, photodynamic therapy, and ultrasound applications. 5.5 Self-Micro Emulsifying Drug Delivery System Lipid-based carriers are available in various forms, including sus- pensions, dry emulsions, microemulsions, and self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS) (Table 3). SEDDS have been recognized for their capability to incorporate hydrophobic drugs. SEDDS has evolved into self-micro emulsifying drug-delivery sys- tems (SMEDDS) an", "ulsions, microemulsions, and self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS) (Table 3).

They represent a ther- modynamically unstable solution that appears semi-transparent (occasionally hazy) and exhibits properties resembling viscous liquids. Emulsions come in three types: water-in-oil, oil-in-water, and multiple emulsions. Moreover, conventional micro- or nano- emulsions differ from SMEDDS in that they self-emulsify following oral ingestion. 12 Santanu Pal et al. 5.6 In Situ Gel Drug Delivery System The in situ gel drug delivery system has emerged as a highly innovative approach to medication administration. Its distinctive property of transitioning from a solution to a gel enables prolonged and controlled release of medications, along with enhancing patient compliance and comfort. Typically, formulations in solution form undergo a transition into gel form under speci\ufb01c physiological conditions before administration. Various stimuli, including pH alterations, temperature changes, and solvent exchange, contribute to this transformation from solution to gel form. Four mechanisms are recognized for generating in situ gel biomaterials, including temperature and pH \ufb02uctuations, alterations in the physical char- acteristics of biomaterials such as solvent exchange and swelling, biochemical modi\ufb01cations like enzymatic and chemical reactions, and photo-polymerization. This technology utilizes microfabrication techniques to create micro-/nano-scale electromechanical and mechanical devices or implants. MEMS-based devices are designed using a wide array of materials and processes, with the most commonly employed approach involving a creative combination of different microma- chining techniques", "le electromechanical and mechanical devices or implants. MEMS-based devices are designed using a wide array of materials and processes, with the most commonly employed approach involving a creative combination of different microma- chining techniques. These techniques include deposition (an additive process), etching (a subtractive process), lithography (a patterning process), ink jetting, ion implantation, oxidation, and micro molding. In drug delivery systems, MEMS technology con- structs miniature systems composed of diverse materials such as silicon, glass, metals, nitrides, and polymers. These systems may incorporate micropumps, sensors, microvalves, reservoirs, actua- tors, and high-performance processors. MEMS-based devices are crucial for achieving targeted and precise drug delivery through controlled and pulsatile release of enclosed pharmaceuticals. These devices can be designed as either electric-powered or non-electric- powered systems. Electric-powered devices enable selective drug release from reservoirs via electric potential, whereas non-powered devices utilize diffusion and osmotic environmental stimulus mechanisms to facilitate drug release. Among MEMS technologies applicable in drug delivery, microchips are the most widely utilized, followed by micro\ufb02uidic devices, particularly micropumps. Drug delivery devices produced through MEMS technologies present numerous advantages compared to traditional delivery methods.", "These include improved performance, automation, precision, and ef\ufb01cacy resulting from the integration of miniaturized sizes with multifunctional components. Moreover, MEMS-based devices contribute to reduced pain and invasiveness during use. Addition- ally, they enable drug stability maintenance during encapsulation, adjustable and continuous delivery, and facilitate the automated release of multiple drugs from reservoirs. Introduction to Drug Delivery System: Past, Present, and Future Perspectives 13 5.8 Targeted Drug Delivery The demand for targeted drug delivery (TDD) over conventional drug delivery systems (DSS) stems from four key factors: the inad- equate performance of drugs concerning pharmacodynamic, phar- macokinetic, pharmaceutical, and pharmacotherapeutic aspects with conventional delivery methods (Fig. 4). Delivering drugs to speci\ufb01c areas using optimized drug delivery methods is essential not only for improving therapeutic effectiveness but also for minimiz- ing toxicity linked to drugs with a narrow therapeutic index and high doses. Targeting is necessary to address the limitations and inherent drawbacks of conventional drug delivery systems (DDSs). Parenteral delivery is invasive, oral administration is unsuitable for protein- or peptide-based drugs, and topical creams and ointments are primarily restricted to local effects. Moreover, the ef\ufb01cacy of drug-target interactions is diminished unless the drug is trans- ported to its intended site of action at a dosage and rate that minimizes side effects while maximizing therapeutic bene\ufb01ts [7]. Moreover, simpler drug administration processes, reduced drug quantities leading to lower therapeutic costs, and the ability to signi\ufb01cantly enhance drug concentration in target areas without adversely affecting non-ta", "mizing therapeutic bene\ufb01ts [7]. Moreover, simpler drug administration processes, reduced drug quantities leading to lower therapeutic costs, and the ability to signi\ufb01cantly enhance drug concentration in target areas without adversely affecting non-target areas are all promising advantages of targeted drug delivery (TDD). Overall, drug targeting results in improved effectiveness, regulated pharmacokinetics, controlled Fig. 4 The illustration of the necessity for targeted drug delivery over conventional drug delivery systems", "distribution throughout the body, heightened speci\ufb01city in locali- zation, decreased toxicity, lowered dosage requirements, and enhanced patient adherence to treatment regimens. 14 Santanu Pal et al. The fundamental concept of drug targeting involves delivering a concentrated amount of drug to the intended site while minimiz- ing its presence in non-targeted areas. This approach helps maxi- mize the therapeutic effects of the drug while reducing side effects resulting from interactions with multiple targets, high doses, and unintended concentrations in non-targeted regions. Additionally, targeting helps mitigate unwanted interactions between the drug and biological environmental factors that may hinder its access to targeted sites within the body. Drug targeting involves the synchro- nized actions of the drug, the target site, and the pharmaceutical carrier. The target refers to the particular organ, cell, or group of cells, either in a chronic or acute condition requiring treatment, with which the drug will interact. The carrier is a specially designed molecule or system crucial for ef\ufb01ciently transporting the loaded drug to predetermined sites. Ideally, a drug-targeting complex should be non-toxic, non-immunogenic, biochemically inactive, biodegradable, biocompatible, and exhibit stability both in vivo and in vitro. To ensure that these ideal characteristics are met, targeted drug products should be formulated while taking into account the unique properties of target cells and the characteristics of transport carriers or vehicles responsible for delivering the drug to speci\ufb01c receptors. While targeted drug delivery (TDD) can address various chronic and infectious diseases, its primary signi\ufb01- cance lies in cancer treatment, attributed to its improved penetra- tion of ", "ehicles responsible for delivering the drug to speci\ufb01c receptors. While targeted drug delivery (TDD) can address various chronic and infectious diseases, its primary signi\ufb01- cance lies in cancer treatment, attributed to its improved penetra- tion of tumors and enhanced concentration at the infection site. Promising applications and objectives of TDD encompass cancer therapy, vaccine enhancement, delivery to ocular and brain regions, DNA and oligonucleotide transport, targeting intracellularly and systemically, administering orally and transdermally, conducting enzyme immunoassays, and performing radioimaging. Drug targeting can be categorized into three (or four) distinct levels of targeting. First-order targeting involves restricting the distribution of the drug-carrier system to the capillary bed of the target site. Second-order targeting entails delivering drugs selec- tively to speci\ufb01c cell types, such as tumor cells. Third-order target- ing focuses on directing drugs to intracellular sites speci\ufb01cally, while fourth-order targeting is occasionally referred to as drugs targeting macromolecules like DNA and proteins. Physical targeting involves systems that concentrate agents in target regions due to their size, composition, or other inherent characteristics, rather than being speci\ufb01cally designed for a biological receptor. Chemical targeting entails directing agents to targeted areas using site-speci\ufb01c prodrugs. Agents can also be guided to speci\ufb01c areas through enzymatic or chemical reactions, leading to the targeting of a vehicle or the controlled release or", " a vehicle or the controlled release or", "action of the agent. Biological targeting allows localized agents to concentrate in target areas using antibodies (Abs), peptides, pro- teins, or other biomolecules that possess af\ufb01nity with receptors, sites, or other biological targets in a speci\ufb01c manner. Gene expres- sion can also be localized to target areas using cells, tissue, or speci\ufb01c promoters within vector systems. Introduction to Drug Delivery System: Past, Present, and Future Perspectives 15 Locally targeted systems are noninvasive targeting approaches primarily aimed at delivering drugs to a speci\ufb01c local site to manage local pathologies. In contrast, systemic targeting involves delivering therapeutic systems via an invasive route, such as intravenous administration of nanotechnological systems. These systems dis- tribute the drug throughout the body via systemic circulation. The primary limitations of systemic targeting stem from the adverse effects of drugs on nonspeci\ufb01c tissues. Targeted drug delivery (TDD) employing location-based stra- tegies involves delivering drugs to speci\ufb01c cells, organs, and orga- nelles. Examples of location-based targeting include intracellular targeting, gastrointestinal tract (GIT) targeting, brain targeting, and targeting the respiratory tract. Intracellular delivery of pharma- ceutical agents, such as proteins, antibodies (Abs), and drug-loaded nanocarriers, ensures that therapeutic action is speci\ufb01cally directed to the nucleus or speci\ufb01c organelles. Floating drug delivery (DD) exempli\ufb01es this targeting approach, where antiviral, antifun- gal, and antibiotic agents are absorbed from speci\ufb01c regions of the GIT. Various site-speci\ufb01c oral controlled-release systems have been developed to target the stomach/duodenum, small intestine, lymph nodes, and colon. Polymer-based drug ", "l, antifun- gal, and antibiotic agents are absorbed from speci\ufb01c regions of the GIT. Various site-speci\ufb01c oral controlled-release systems have been developed to target the stomach/duodenum, small intestine, lymph nodes, and colon. Polymer-based drug delivery systems (DDSs), such as dopamine-liposome conjugates, demonstrate effective brain targeting with reduced degradation during circula- tion. Additionally, disease-based targeted delivery involves site- speci\ufb01c therapy targeting tumors and other treatable infectious diseases. 6 Ceramic-Based Drug Delivery System Ceramic materials possess numerous desirable properties, including ease of preparation, adjustable size and structure, high surface area to volume ratio, stability under physiological conditions, and excel- lent biocompatibility (Fig. 5). Consequently, they have been widely utilized in the \ufb01eld of drug delivery systems (DDS) for many years, serving as drug carriers. Traditional ceramic materials are com- prised of inorganic solid compounds, primarily consisting of car- bides, and oxides such as hydroxyapatite, tricalcium phosphate, silica, zeolite, and zirconia. The need for effective dose require- ments (ED50) may diminish due to the enhanced delivery ef\ufb01- ciency of controlled, sustained, and targeted drug delivery systems (DDS), potentially leading to cost reductions for patients.", "There is a growing demand for local, homogeneous, controlled, and sustained drug release [17]. Therefore, it is crucial to develop carriers with adjustable size and structure, favorable stability under physiological conditions, excellent biocompatibility, and high uptake ef\ufb01ciency. In this regard, ceramics emerge as an attractive material choice for carriers. 16 Santanu Pal et al. Fig. 5 Ceramic-based drug delivery system working on the principle of using ceramic materials to encapsulate and release therapeutic agents in a controlled manner Ceramic-based drug carriers have garnered growing interest alongside advancements in medicine, pharmaceutics, and material science. Prominent bioceramics include beta-tricalcium phosphate (\u03b2-TCP), hydroxyapatite, mesoporous silica, and zirconia hydroxy- apatite composite, among others. Additionally, bioceramics consti- tute integral components of certain inorganic-organic composites employed as drug carriers. The bene\ufb01ts of ceramic-based drug carriers include the following: 1. They offer adjustable size and structure, making them suitable for accommodating nano-sized drugs. 2. They exhibit low toxicity, as ceramics typically possess good biocompatibility, biodegradability, and biological stability. 3. Certain ceramics demonstrate sensitivity to environmental fac- tors such as light, magnetism, or heat, allowing them to respond accordingly. 7 Polysaccharide-Based Drug Delivery System Numerous surface coatings derived from polysaccharides have been suggested to confer antimicrobial attributes to implantable materi- als, primarily metals and polymers. Medical surface functionaliza- tion with antimicrobial agents provides an alternative to conventional drug delivery methods.

Medical surface functionaliza- tion with antimicrobial agents provides an alternative to conventional drug delivery methods. This delivery system can be employed for systemic and topical applications and can be", "administered through various routes, including oral, buccal, sub- lingual, ocular, and transdermal, based on the intended purpose. Hence, designing effective coatings requires a comprehensive understanding of the pharmacological characteristics of drugs and polysaccharides, along with a careful selection of manufacturing techniques. Polysaccharides serve various functions, including facil- itating rapid drug absorption in the gastrointestinal tract or deliv- ering drugs directly to the administration site. They are particularly suitable for drugs with high mucosal permeability, commonly uti- lized in buccal and sublingual delivery methods. Ophthalmic coat- ings are primarily employed to treat anterior segment diseases. Orodispersible \ufb01lms, also known as soluble \ufb01lms, dissolve quickly in the oral cavity. Fast-dissolving oral \ufb01lms have very thin dimen- sions and dissolve within a minute in the mouth. Buccal adhesive \ufb01lms deliver drugs directly through the buccal mucosa for systemic circulation post-absorption. Wafers are thin polymeric \ufb01lms used as carriers for pharmaceutical agents and do not require water for drug absorption. Polysaccharide coatings are also applied for sur- face modi\ufb01cation of medical devices, particularly in prosthetic applications for orthopedics and dentistry, enabling controlled drug release. Thin \ufb01lms for drug delivery can be formulated through two methods: loading drugs directly onto pre-made poly- saccharide thin \ufb01lms or creating thin \ufb01lms by incorporating drugs as integral components during preparation [8]. Introduction to Drug Delivery System: Past, Present, and Future Perspectives 17 8 Closed Loop Insulin Delivery System Glucose-responsive insulin delivery systems had their beginnings in the 1960s and 1970s when early versions relied on venou", "ion [8]. Introduction to Drug Delivery System: Past, Present, and Future Perspectives 17 8 Closed Loop Insulin Delivery System Glucose-responsive insulin delivery systems had their beginnings in the 1960s and 1970s when early versions relied on venous glucose readings to regulate intravenous infusions of insulin and dextrose to keep blood sugar levels stable. It\u2019s only in recent years that these large, stationary technologies have evolved into compact, wearable devices. Today\u2019s closed-loop systems utilize interstitial glucose monitoring, insulin pumps implanted under the skin, and advanced algorithms to manage blood sugar levels more effectively [9]. In the early 1960s, Arnold Kadish pioneered the \ufb01rst closed-loop insulin delivery system. Kadish\u2019s creation, referred to as a \u201cservomecha- nism for blood glucose control,\u201d consisted of an autoanalyzer for ongoing monitoring of blood glucose levels through an intrave- nous catheter. Additionally, it included two intravenous syringe pumps containing insulin and either glucose or glucagon [17]. In 2005, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) initiated the Arti\ufb01cial Pancreas Project. The primary goal of this endeavor was to support research, facilitate regulatory approval processes, and ultimately encourage the widespread adoption of closed-loop technologies for diabetes management [17]. Low-glucose suspend (LGS) systems represent the most basic form of closed-loop", "systems. These systems are comprised of a combined glucose sensor and insulin pump, which can autonomously halt insulin infusion when blood glucose levels drop below a predetermined threshold, without needing con\ufb01rmation from the user. The advancement of LGS technology led to the development of predictive low-glucose suspend (PLGS) systems. These systems incorporate algorithms capable of forecasting impending hypoglycemia, such as within the next 30 minutes, and proactively pause insulin delivery before the onset of hypoglycemia. Hybrid closed-loop systems are designed to mitigate both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia by regulating glucose levels within a speci\ufb01ed target range. These systems employ a computerized algorithm to modify the basal insulin rate and administer corrective bolus doses as needed. They are termed \u201chybrid\u201d systems because, unlike fully closed-loop sys- tems, users are still responsible for manually inputting insulin boluses when consuming meals. Fully closed-loop systems, as opposed to hybrid systems, are engineered to automate insulin delivery entirely, eliminating the need for user input regarding mealtime boluses. The primary obstacle in fully closed-loop systems lies in managing postprandial hyperglycemia, given the absence of manually provided data regarding meal timing and carbohydrate intake. These instances of postprandial glucose elevation frequently lead to subsequent hypoglycemia due to the delayed effects of current rapid-acting insulins. Two early closed-loop systems, pio- neered by Kadish and Shichiri, employed a dual-hormone strategy, utilizing both insulins to counteract hyperglycemia and glucagon to counteract hypoglycemia. However, the use of glucagon in closed-loop systems became less common during the Biostator era and only reappe", "d Shichiri, employed a dual-hormone strategy, utilizing both insulins to counteract hyperglycemia and glucagon to counteract hypoglycemia. However, the use of glucagon in closed-loop systems became less common during the Biostator era and only reappeared in subcutaneous closed-loop systems in research around the mid-2000s. The main rationale behind dual- hormone systems, capable of administering glucagon boluses alongside continuous insulin infusion, stems from the notion that preventing hypoglycemia is more effective through glucagon administration rather than suspending insulin delivery. This is pri- marily due to the pharmacokinetic properties of subcutaneous insulin and glucagon: currently, available rapid-acting insulins have a relatively slow onset (10\u201315 minutes), delayed time to reach maximum effect (40\u201360 minutes), and extended duration of action (up to 4\u20136 hours), whereas glucagon exhibits a rapid onset within 5 minutes [17]. 18 Santanu Pal et al. 9 Liposome-Mediated Drug Delivery Liposomes are tiny vesicles containing an aqueous core surrounded by a lipid bilayer membrane. A.D. Bangham and R.W. Thorne initially observed these structures in 1964 through electron micros- copy while studying the dispersion of phospholipids in water. They", "noted the spontaneous formation of circular structures resembling bags. Gerald Weissman, a colleague of Bangham, coined the term \u201cliposomes\u201d to describe these structures. This discovery proved to be highly versatile and found applications in various \ufb01elds including biology, biochemistry, and medicine. Liposomes became popular in vesicular research due to their biocompatibility and structural simi- larities to biological cells [10]. The quantity of drug encapsulated within liposomes and the size of the liposomes are critical factors in\ufb02uencing the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the drug. Liposomes typically range in size with an average diameter of around 100 nm. Because of their size and the combi- nation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic characteristics, liposomes represent promising platforms for drug delivery. Liposomes have demonstrated signi\ufb01cant commercial signi\ufb01cance, starting from the earliest product, \u201cDoxil,\u201d which was a PEGylated doxorubicin liposomal formulation, to the most recent product, \u201cMarqibo,\u201d which is a vincristine sulfate liposomal formulation. The properties of liposomes vary greatly depending on factors such as lipid com- position, surface charge, size, and preparation method. The com- position of the phospholipid bilayer dictates the rigidity or \ufb02uidity of the vesicles, as well as their charge [8]. Liposomes are created through various methods, involving the entrapment of drugs via either passive or active loading techniques. In the passive loading technique, drug molecules are loaded or encapsulated either before or during the formation of liposomes. During the preparation of liposomes, when the lipid \ufb01lm is dissolved in a buffer containing the drug, hydrophilic or water-soluble drugs are loaded into the center of the liposome v", " or encapsulated either before or during the formation of liposomes. During the preparation of liposomes, when the lipid \ufb01lm is dissolved in a buffer containing the drug, hydrophilic or water-soluble drugs are loaded into the center of the liposome vesicle. Lipophilic drugs, on the other hand, are added to the lipid phase of the liposome components, allowing them to be loaded in between the lipid bilayers. Any unentrapped drug is typically removed using gel-\ufb01ltration chromatography or dialysis for liposomal dispersion. Passive loading encompasses four distinct methods, which are: Introduction to Drug Delivery System: Past, Present, and Future Perspectives 19 1. Mechanical Dispersion: Involves physical techniques to dis- perse the drug within the liposome matrix. 2. Solvent Dispersion Method: Involves replacing organic sol- vents with an aqueous phase to entrap the drug within liposomes. 3. Size Change or Combination Vesicle Method: This involves altering the size of vesicles or combining them to encapsulate the drug. 4. Detergent Removal Methods: Involves removing detergents used in liposome preparation to encapsulate the drug. The remote or active loading method involves loading com- pounds with both aqueous and lipid solubility, along with ionizable groups, after the formation of vesicles. This technique allows for", "the loading of drug molecules post-formation. Several methods exist for preparing liposomes using this active loading approach. Doxil\u2122 is an example of a liposomal product prepared using this method. Extended treatment with anticancer medications often results in numerous toxic effects. However, using liposomal for- mulations speci\ufb01cally targeted at tumor cells has shown reduced side effects. Studies have demonstrated that liposomes can effec- tively target tumor cells and circulate in the bloodstream for longer durations due to enhanced vascular permeability. In 1995, Doxil, a PEGylated liposomal formulation of doxorubicin designed for intravenous administration using stealth technology, received approval for the treatment of hematological tumors. Additionally, Caelyx and Myocet are other liposomal preparations of doxorubicin utilized for advanced breast cancer treatment. 20 Santanu Pal et al. 10 Dendrimers Dendrimers are intricate molecular structures composed of a cen- tral core surrounded by well-de\ufb01ned branches, formed through a series of methodical reactions. Each successive reaction iteration results in a dendrimer of higher generation, corresponding to its layer count [11]. Since their inception in the early 1980s, dendri- mers have epitomized controlled hierarchical synthesis, enabling the creation of intricate systems. Notably, dendrimer synthesis allows precise control over size, composition, and chemical reactiv- ity, akin to a \ufb01nely tuned machine. Almost any polymer can serve as the basis for dendrimer syn- thesis. The \ufb01rst extensively characterized dendrimer structure was polyamidoamine dendrimers (PAMAM dendrimers) [12], con- structed through a repetitive sequence of steps (Table 4). Research- ers have successfully obtained PAMAM dendrimers up to generati", "is.

Research- ers have successfully obtained PAMAM dendrimers up to generation 10. Over the past decade, numerous novel dendrimer variants have emerged and undergone exploration, demonstrating promising applicability in various \ufb01elds. 11 PEGylated Drug Delivery System PEG (polyethylene glycol) is widely regarded as the preferred poly- mer for drug conjugation due to its exceptional properties. Never- theless, a signi\ufb01cant drawback of PEG lies in its limited biodegradability. Therefore, there is considerable interest in mod- ifying the structure of PEG to enable its fragmentation, addressing this issue (Table 5). Hydrophilic polymers linked to small molecules like paclitaxel or proteins serve to improve water solubility. Among these carriers, PEG is frequently employed due to its ability to extend the drug\u2019s plasma half-life, thereby averting interactions", "with plasma proteins and masking the molecule. PEG-based drug delivery systems are widely regarded as the benchmark in the phar- maceutical sector for addressing various diseases including cancer, hemophilia, pain, and diabetes. Among these clinical applications, the creation and advancement of PEGylated nanocarriers for con- taining anticancer agents hold signi\ufb01cant importance. Recent advancements in nanosystems designed for tumor treatment exhibit limited accumulation at the target site and inadequate therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy [13]. Present methods for attaching PEG mole- cules to conjugates typically involve the PEGylation process. This process primarily forms a connection between proteins, peptides, or other molecules and a carrier through covalent bonding. In 1990, Adagen (ADA) became the \ufb01rst therapeutic protein PEGylated in this manner. Adagen is utilized in the treatment of various immune disorders stemming from a congenital de\ufb01ciency of the enzyme adenosine deaminase [9]. There are currently three generations of PEGylation methods. The \ufb01rst generation relies on glycosylation reactions. However, this process lacks control, which can lead to multisite PEGylation due to the interaction between the hydroxyl group of PEG and the carboxyl group of the amino acid. The second generation of PEGylation introduces a diverse array of potential conjugates, ranging from gene technology applications to modi\ufb01cation with thioacid or employing chemical ligation stra- tegies. Additionally, it includes N-terminal protein modi\ufb01cation through biomimetic transamination reactions. These methods offer advantageous characteristics such as high molecular weight, activated molecules, and branched PEG structures. However, they often result in reduced biological activity. Consequently, efforts ar", "biomimetic transamination reactions. These methods offer advantageous characteristics such as high molecular weight, activated molecules, and branched PEG structures. However, they often result in reduced biological activity. Consequently, efforts are underway to develop the third generation of PEGylation methods, which seek to preserve bioactivity while retaining the bene\ufb01ts of the Introduction to Drug Delivery System: Past, Present, and Future Perspectives 21 Table 4 The structural elements of dendrimers [17] Sl.

There exists various methods for releasing pharmaceutical agents, including enzymatic cleavage, pH gradient modulation, temperature-triggered hydrolysis, surface modi\ufb01ca- tion activation, swelling mechanisms, and controlling the half-life of the speci\ufb01c bond between the polymer and the drug. Since the discovery of PEGylated technology in the 1990s, advancements have occurred in several areas: transitioning from random to site- speci\ufb01c PEGylation (Phase I), from linear to multibranched PEGs (Phase II), and from low to high molecular weights (Phase III). Furthermore, PEGylation is now utilized in a broader spectrum of therapies, leading to expanded clinical pipelines for numerous bio- technological \ufb01rms. With PEG-based conjugates already estab- lished in medicinal treatments, the focus of PEGylation processes is shifting toward achieving lower doses and longer-lasting thera- peutic effects. 22 Santanu Pal et al.

As drug engineering progresses and new biological under- standings of drug mechanisms emerge, the \ufb01eld of ADCs is still in its early stages of evolution. More than a century ago, the concept of targeted chemotherapy was proposed by German scientist Paul Ehrlich. He envisioned a \u201cmagic bullet\u201d that could deliver cytotox- ins speci\ufb01cally to targeted structures within diseased cells while sparing healthy tissues [14]. The essential elements of an ADC include a monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting a tumor-associated antigen, a cytotoxic payload, and a connecting linker. Each of these components and their interactions are pivotal in determining the effectiveness and potential toxicity of an ADC [10]. The antibody component of an ADC in\ufb02uences its duration in plasma circulation, potential for immunogenic responses, immune-related functions, and speci\ufb01city to the target. Presently, ADCs primarily utilize immunoglobulin G (IgG) as the antibody format, with IgG1 being the most commonly employed. IgG1 provides an extended serum half-life and robust Fc-mediated immune functions, which encompass antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, and complement-dependent cytotoxicity. HER2 and trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (TROP2) are being targeted for ADC develop- ment in breast cancer (BC) because they are highly expressed on the surfaces of tumor cells while showing limited expression in normal tissues [10]. Payloads are the chemotherapeutic agents responsible for exerting cytotoxic effects on the tumor cells targeted by ADCs. Typically, these agents function by binding to microtubules or inducing DNA damage, which can involve DNA cleavage or alkyl- ation. With advancements in linker conjugation chemistry and a better und", "otoxic effects on the tumor cells targeted by ADCs. Typically, these agents function by binding to microtubules or inducing DNA damage, which can involve DNA cleavage or alkyl- ation. With advancements in linker conjugation chemistry and a better understanding of the in vivo mechanism of ADCs, there is now a wider range of anticancer agents being incorporated into newer ADC designs. The main mechanism of action for ADCs involves targeting the cytotoxic payload speci\ufb01cally to tumor cells. Upon binding of the monoclonal antibody (mAb) to the target antigen, the ADC is internalized within the tumor cell. The subsequent breakdown of the linker leads to the release of the payload inside the cell, where it can then exert its cytotoxic effects, such as damaging microtubules or DNA. The process of antibody binding and internalization may be further manipulated or enhanced through pharmacological interventions. Besides the con- ventional mechanism of payload release and action, the antibody component of ADCs can also exhibit anticancer effects indepen- dently of the payload. By binding to the target antigen, the anti- body can disrupt the antigen\u2019s downstream functions by inhibiting its interaction with binding partners or promoting its degradation. Moreover, ADCs can exert antitumor effects through the activation of immune responses, such as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), as seen with trastuzumab [10]. The intro- duction of ADCs for treating metastatic cancers in the last decade Introduction to Drug Delivery System: Past, Present, and Future Perspectives 23", "ystem: Past, Present, and Future Perspectives 23", "has notably enhanced outcomes across various solid tumors. How- ever, patients undergoing these therapies eventually encounter dis- ease progression, often due to resistance. Given that ADCs represent a relatively recent addition to oncology treatments, the mechanisms underlying resistance are not yet fully understood. Resistance may arise from various factors related to the components of ADCs, such as modi\ufb01cations in target cell surface expression or gene mutations, increased expression of drug ef\ufb02ux transporters to counteract payload toxicity, alterations in the traf\ufb01cking and inter- nalization rates of the ADC, or simply resistance to the payload itself. 24 Santanu Pal et al. 13 Mesoporous Silica-Based Drug Delivery Kresge et al. have demonstrated a method that combines sol-gel chemistry with liquid crystal templating to create ordered porous molecular sieves characterized by regularly spaced mesopores (ranging from 2 nm to 50 nm) embedded within a silica matrix. Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) have emerged as a promising and innovative drug delivery vehicle due to their distinc- tive mesoporous structure, which preserves a degree of chemical stability, surface functionality, and biocompatibility. This structure ensures controlled and targeted delivery of various active pharma- ceutical ingredients (APIs) [15]. Mesoporous silica materials, dis- covered by the Mobile Oil Corporation in 1992, have garnered signi\ufb01cant attention due to their outstanding properties, including high surface area, large pore volume, tunable pore diameter, and adjustable pore size distribution. The low toxicity and high drug- loading capacity of mesoporous silica nanoparticles make them particularly advantageous for controlled and targeted drug delivery applications. Mesoporous silica ", "e pore diameter, and adjustable pore size distribution. The low toxicity and high drug- loading capacity of mesoporous silica nanoparticles make them particularly advantageous for controlled and targeted drug delivery applications. Mesoporous silica exhibits unique properties, particu- larly in its ability to load high amounts of drug nanoparticles and facilitate subsequent delivery. Due to the strong Si-O bond, silica- based mesoporous nanoparticles are more resistant to external reactions such as degradation and mechanical stress compared to niosomes, liposomes, and dendrimers. This characteristic reduces the necessity for external modi\ufb01cations during the synthesis of MSNs. 14 Transdermal Drug Delivery System Transdermal drug delivery (TDD) is a noninvasive systemic deliv- ery approach where drugs are applied to healthy and intact skin. The drug initially permeates through the stratum corneum, fol- lowed by passage through the deeper epidermis and dermis without signi\ufb01cant accumulation in the dermal layer. Once the drug reaches", "the dermal layer, it becomes accessible for systemic absorption through dermal microcirculation. Over time, \ufb01rst-generation trans- dermal delivery systems have advanced and become established in clinical practice. They are typically utilized for administering small, lipophilic, and low-dose drugs. Second-generation delivery sys- tems, employing different designs incorporating chemical enhan- cers, non-cavitational ultrasound, and iontophoresis, have also resulted in clinical products. Third-generation delivery systems focus on targeting the stratum corneum using methods such as microneedles, thermal ablation, microdermabrasion, electropora- tion, and cavitational ultrasound. Presently, transdermal drug deliv- ery systems utilizing microneedle and thermal ablation technology have been developed and are progressing through clinical trials for the delivery of macromolecules, such as insulin and parathyroid hormone. A transdermal drug delivery system (TDDS) typically consists of essential components such as a polymer matrix, mem- brane, drug, penetration enhancers, pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSA), backing laminates, and release coatings. Types of TDDS are as follows Introduction to Drug Delivery System: Past, Present, and Future Perspectives 25 1. Single-layer (unilayer): Fabricated with three layers, including a temporary liner at the bottom, an adhesive in the middle, and a backing on top, this design is referred to as a single-layer system. In this setup, the adhesive layer serves a dual purpose: providing adhesion to the skin and serving as a container for the active molecule. 2. Multilayer: Similar to the single-layer design, this system fea- tures an adhesive layer that doubles as the drug-containing layer. However, it differs by incorporating an additional layer o", "skin and serving as a container for the active molecule. 2. Multilayer: Similar to the single-layer design, this system fea- tures an adhesive layer that doubles as the drug-containing layer. However, it differs by incorporating an additional layer of drug adhesive, typically separated by a membrane. Addition- ally, it includes a temporary liner and a permanent backing. 3. Reservoir: In contrast to both the unilayer and multilayer designs, this system incorporates a distinct drug layer. This layer comprises a liquid compartment containing the drug in either solution or suspension, separated by an adhesive layer. Additionally, the patch includes a backing and a temporary liner. The release kinetics of this system follow a zero-order pattern. 4. Matrix: This system features a drug layer consisting of a semi- solid matrix containing a solution or suspension of the drug. The adhesive layer partially surrounds the drug layer, effectively enveloping it. 5. Vapor: The adhesive layer of the patch is infused with oils or another solution that vaporizes for release. Some patches release essential oils for over 6 hours, useful for decongestion purposes, while others aim to enhance sleep quality.", "26 Santanu Pal et al. 15 Hydrogel-Mediated Ocular Drug Delivery Hydrogels consist of a mesh-like structure of water-loving polymer chains that can hold a signi\ufb01cant amount of water. When applied, these gels start as a liquid but turn into a gel once they come into contact with the eye. The three main types of responsive materials commonly used to create gel systems for administering eye medica- tions are those sensitive to heat, pH, and ions. Recent advance- ments in hydrogel technology present promising prospects for delivering drugs to treat eye conditions effectively [16]. Recent advancements in hydrogel technology present promising prospects for treating ocular diseases through improved delivery of ophthal- mic drugs. Hydrogels can enhance drug ef\ufb01cacy by (1) extending drug retention duration at the delivery site, (2) maintaining sus- tained drug release at the desired location, and (3) facilitating the simultaneous delivery of multiple drugs to their respective func- tions. Fang et al. created a polypseudorotaxane hydrogel to address anterior uveitis. This was achieved by blending Soluplus micelles (with a size of 99.4 nm) with cyclodextrin solutions [11]. Jung et al. devised an in situ hydrogel composed of Bevacizumab (Bev) and hyaluronic acid cross-linked with poly(ethylene glycol) diacry- late. This hydrogel was slowly released after Bev injection into the suprachoroidal space of the eye using microneedles (MNs). The Bev-hyaluronic acid hydrogel formed in situ was well tolerated and exhibited sustained Bev release for more than 6 months in rabbit eyes, suggesting its potential for treating posterior ocular diseases in upcoming applications [11]. Gao et al. recently created an injectable antibody-loaded supramolecular nano\ufb01ber hydrogel by blending betamethasone p", "r more than 6 months in rabbit eyes, suggesting its potential for treating posterior ocular diseases in upcoming applications [11]. Gao et al. recently created an injectable antibody-loaded supramolecular nano\ufb01ber hydrogel by blending betamethasone phosphate with CaCl2. This hydrogel, based on betamethasone phosphate, can release anti-VEGF agents, which can effectively inhibit retinal vascular proliferation, diminish choroidal neovascularization (CNV) over an extended period, and mitigate reactive oxygen species (ROS) to alleviate local in\ufb02ammation [11]. 16 Challenges with Current Drug Delivery Systems Recent advancements have shown the successful utilization of vari- ous delivery systems aimed at transporting drugs from diverse plant sources to their intended sites within the body for treatment. Despite signi\ufb01cant progress, these systems still encounter numer- ous limitations and challenges in achieving their therapeutic objec- tives. The scarcity and inconsistency of information, which is crucial for guiding industries, may hinder the future advancements of nanomedicines and prolong the transition from research and exper- imentation to clinical application [2]. Numerous researchers", "acknowledge the dual nature of nanoparticles\u2014they can have posi- tive or negative impacts. While the advantages of nanoparticles are well established and acknowledged, there is a lack of comprehensive information regarding their safety, their interactions with non-speci\ufb01c proteins, and their behavior and interaction with organs other than their intended targets [2]. Certain delivery sys- tems employ large particles as carriers, which pose challenges such as limited absorption and solubility, instability in vivo, low bioavail- ability, dif\ufb01culties in achieving target-speci\ufb01c delivery, and various adverse side effects upon administration. Utilizing signi\ufb01cantly smaller particles for delivery into the human biological system offers a solution to these challenges associated with larger particles. Achieving target-speci\ufb01c delivery poses a challenge for all delivery systems. While target-speci\ufb01c delivery has demonstrated the poten- tial to reduce toxicity and enhance treatment effectiveness, its ef\ufb01cacy relies on ensuring suf\ufb01cient amounts of the therapeutic reach the intended site. This challenge is evident when administer- ing siRNA systemically, as they often fail to reach their target cell or organ due to degradation by bodily enzymes. Additionally, admin- istering siRNA in large quantities presents another hurdle, as their negative charge impedes absorption by cells, leading to minimal or no uptake by the body [2]. Research is investigating micelles and liposomes, categorized as lipid nanoparticles, for targeted drug delivery. However, their effectiveness may be compromised due to interactions with the body. These interactions, such as phagocytic absorption and hepatic \ufb01ltration, have the potential to impede target delivery and may also result in toxicity associated with", ". However, their effectiveness may be compromised due to interactions with the body. These interactions, such as phagocytic absorption and hepatic \ufb01ltration, have the potential to impede target delivery and may also result in toxicity associated with the nanoparticles. The kidney and liver possess inherent mechanisms for detoxifying the body, which may perceive nanoparticles as potential waste. This natural function can hinder drug delivery by causing obstruction and potentially resulting in the buildup of nanoparticles within these organs. Introduction to Drug Delivery System: Past, Present, and Future Perspectives 27 17 Future Direction and Conclusion Although challenges have impeded the clinical implementation of these delivery systems, the latest advancements in drug delivery show signi\ufb01cant promise. Realizing this potential would necessitate collaboration spanning academic theory, laboratory research, med- ical knowledge, pharmaceutical expertise, and extensive research efforts to effectively transition \ufb01ndings from experimental stages to practical clinical applications. According to Vargason et al., the integration of cell therapies holds the potential to address bio-acceptability challenges encountered by drug delivery systems. They refer that cell therapies could offer a solution by providing a single effective dose, thus mitigating the issue of excessive drug accumulation within the body. Furthermore, cell therapies offer the", "prospect of serving as a sustained source of intricate biologics, overcoming inherent biological barriers, and eliciting responses that mimic natural processes within the body [2]. According to Khalid et al., enhancing drug delivery ef\ufb01cacy can be achieved by utilizing priming agents capable of modifying the biological envi- ronment at the site of administration. These agents have the poten- tial to alter tissue form and function, rendering the administered drug more favorable without causing harm to the patient. Addi- tionally, the utilization of cell-based drug systems within the realm of biomaterials should be explored. This entails integrating cells with nano-biomaterials, leveraging the innate compatibility of cells with the human system. While still in the theoretical stage, this approach is considered innovative and holds promise for optimiz- ing drug delivery methods to achieve maximum ef\ufb01cacy. 28 Santanu Pal et al.

The Greek elements \u201cpharmakon\u201d (drug) and \u201ckinesis\u201d (movement) are the origin of the English term \u201cpharmacokinetics,\u201d which describes the movement of a drug. Pharmacokinetics is the mathematical study of the time- dependent variation in medication concentrations. So, to sum up, pharmacokinetics is the study of how medications enter, travel through, and are eliminated from the body by means of metabolism and excretion. Pharmaceuticals depend on pharmacokinetics research since it determines the dosage, mode of administra- tion, time of peak effect, duration of action, and frequency of drug administration. Principles of pharmaco- kinetics center on variations in drug concentration brought about by drug absorption, distribution, and elimination throughout time. There are two primary ways that drugs and chemicals get beyond biological membranes: simple transfer and specialized transport. The process by which an unaltered medication enters the bloodstream from the place of administration is known as absorption. Due to the porosity of the capillaries, even big lipid-insoluble or ionized medicines are absorbed, whereas lipid-soluble medications readily pass through the capillary endothelium. The process by which medications enter extravascular \ufb02uids and tissues and leave the bloodstream is known as distribution. This critical pharmacokinetic phase affects not only the organs involved in metabolism and excretion but also the way that medicines reach their target areas. The process o", "ascular \ufb02uids and tissues and leave the bloodstream is known as distribution. This critical pharmacokinetic phase affects not only the organs involved in metabolism and excretion but also the way that medicines reach their target areas. The process of changing a substance\u2019s chemical form to one that is more water soluble for simpler excretion is called metabolism. Particularly, \u201cbiotransformation\u201d describes the chemical alterations that foreign substances go through in the body. There are two main stages of biotransformation. Phase I consists of processes involving oxidation, reduction, and hydrolysis that add or reveal tiny polar functional groups (such -OH and -NH2). In order to prepare lipid-soluble medications for Phase II reactions or direct excretion, this phase alters them to make them more polar. Conjugation is the process by which polar endogenous compounds (such as sulfate or glucuronic acid) are joined to medications or their Phase I metabolites in Phase II. This step results in readily excreted conjugates that are soluble in water. The process of permanently eliminating medications and their metabolites from the body is called excretion. Water- soluble and ionized compounds are excreted more readily by excretory organs\u2014apart from the lungs\u2014than lipid-soluble ones, which must \ufb01rst be converted into water-soluble forms in order to be excreted more easily. The drug\u2019s concentration in the body has an impact on pharmacokinetic processes (ADME), and how that concentration in\ufb02uences the process rate is known as the process order. Key pharmacokinetic parameters may be computed and the time course of medications in the body can be expressed quantita- tively using pharmacokinetic models. Pharmacokinetics is determined by three factors: elimination, distri- bution and ", "ess order.

It is necessary to study the rate of drug absorption because, although it is not always ideal, faster drug absorption results in a faster onset of medication effect, which is necessary for treating acute disorders and in emergency situations. Researching the degree of drug absorption is crucial since the amount of the drug that is absorbed and enters the systemic circulations is what causes the pharmaco- logical effect [1]. The pace of medication distribution to its site of affection impacts the beginning of action and the extent of distribution de\ufb01nes the degree of the effect. The frequency of drug administra- tion needed during multiple drug administration to make up for the drug that is removed is determined by the rate of drug elimina- tion. Drugs that are removed more quickly need to be administered often in order to maintain an effective drug concentration during the course of many administrations. The primary pharmacological principle in the therapeutic use of pharmaceuticals is to pick the appropriate dose regimen for each individual animal based on the patient\u2019s personal information and the medication pharmacokinetic properties. The patient\u2019s unique pharmacokinetic parameter can be ascertained during drug admin- istration by using the blood drug concentration measured at a certain time point. The combined effects of drug distribution and elimination processes (metabolism and excretion), which usually happen after intravenous (IV) injection, are referred to as \u201cdrug disposi", "ing the blood drug concentration measured at a certain time point. The combined effects of drug distribution and elimination processes (metabolism and excretion), which usually happen after intravenous (IV) injection, are referred to as \u201cdrug disposition.\u201d 2 Pharmacokinetic Principles The main focus of pharmacokinetic principles is how changes in drug concentration over time are caused by drug absorption, dis- tribution, and elimination. Understanding the relationship between drug effects and concentration in the body is essential. Pharmacokinetics is the mathematical study of how drug concen- trations change over time. The extent and speed of ADME pro- cesses, the right doses and schedules for drugs, the concentrations of both therapeutic and toxic drugs, the levels of drugs in bodily \ufb02uids and tissues, the half-life and duration of action of drugs, the impact of diseases on drug kinetics, the duration of drug with- drawal in food animals and the types of drug interactions are all determined by pharmacokinetic principles [3] (Fig. 1).", "Fundamentals of Pharmacokinetics and Drug Delivery 31 Fig. 1 Flowchart for principles of pharmacokinetics 2.1 Application of the Pharmacokinetic Principle in the Biomedical Fields \u2022 Design and evaluation of dosage forms \u2022 Evaluations of drug formulation \u2022 Pharmacological testing \u2022 Dosing regimen design 3 Cell Membrane/Biological Membrane The hydrocarbon chains of the amphipathic lipids in the plasma membrane are orientated inward to produce a continuous hydro- phobic phase, while the hydrophilic heads of the lipids are oriented outward. The bilayer\u2019s individual lipid molecules differ depending on the speci\ufb01c membrane and have the ability to migrate laterally, giving the membrane \ufb02exibility and \ufb02uidity, high relative imperme- ability to highly polar compounds, and high electrical resistance. Membrane proteins that are integrated into the bilayer function as transporters, ion channels, or receptors to trigger chemical or electrical signaling pathways and offer speci\ufb01c sites for medication action. Organs, cells, and intracellular activity within the body are categorized and organized by highly specialized molecular barriers called biological membranes. Medication must pass through one or more of these membranes in order to reach its intended location, regardless of the mode of administration. These barriers can be as simple as a single layer of cells found in enterocytes and renal tubular epithelial cells, or as complex as many layers of cells found in the skin, vagina, and placenta. The membranes of individual cells, mitochondria, and the nucleus are examples of situations where the barrier can be much thinner. Polar lipid molecules, such as", "ria, and the nucleus are examples of situations where the barrier can be much thinner. Polar lipid molecules, such as", "phospholipids, are the main building blocks of biological mem- branes. These molecules create a bilayer. The hydrophobic (fatty acid) tails of this bilayer face inward, while the hydrophilic (water- attracting) heads are directed toward the membrane surfaces. 32 Asha et al. Drug molecules can be carried by bulk water \ufb02ow, as most cell membranes are reasonably permeable to water either by diffusion or \ufb02ow caused by hydrostatic or osmotic variations across the membrane. The main method by which medications penetrate the majority of capillary endothelial membranes is by this type of trans- port. However, trans-capillary movement is restricted to unbound drug since bound proteins and drug molecules are too big and polar for this kind of transport to happen. The amount of para- cellular transfer across intercellular gaps is so great that blood \ufb02ow, rather than other parameters, is the limiting factor for transit across most capillaries. This kind of transport plays a crucial role in the kidney\u2019s glomerular membrane \ufb01ltration, as will be discussed later. However, there are signi\ufb01cant exceptions to this general rule in capillary diffusion because certain tissues have \u201ctight\u201d intercellular connections and have restricted paracellular transit. Tight junctions are found in the capillaries of the central nervous system (CNS) and many different types of epithelial tissues. 3.1 Passage of Drugs Across Biological Membranes A medication must cross cell membranes in order to be absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms by which medications cross mem- branes as well as the physicochemical characteristics of molecules and membranes that affect this transfer. A drug\u2019s molecular size and structure, degree of ionization, relative", " is crucial to understand the mechanisms by which medications cross mem- branes as well as the physicochemical characteristics of molecules and membranes that affect this transfer. A drug\u2019s molecular size and structure, degree of ionization, relative lipid solubility of its ionized and non-ionized forms, and ability to bind to tissue proteins are its de\ufb01ning properties. It goes without saying that a medicine must cross the plasma membrane of the cell in order to enter the cell. Additional cell layers (skin) or a single layer of cells (intestinal epithelium) may act as barriers to the transport of drugs. Since pharmaceuticals generally travel through cells rather than between them, there are many common properties that characterize drug dispersion and transport across these different barriers, despite their structural variations. Thus, the common barrier is represented by the plasma membrane. There are two primary ways that drugs and chemicals get beyond biological membranes: simple transfer and specialized transport (Fig. 2). 3.1.1 Simple Transport A. Diffusion One of the main ways that medications get through biological membranes is by diffusion, often known as passive diffusion. Under the in\ufb02uence of the concentration gradient, lipid-soluble com- pounds and unionized pharmaceuticals pass through the", "\u00de \u00de Rate of diffusion molecules per unit time \u00f0 = C1 - C2 \u00f0 = A \u00d7 D \u00d7 Km=w T membrane in this manner without the requirement for energy or carriers. Until an equilibrium is attained, drugs diffuse from areas of higher concentration to areas of lower concentration. This process has no structural character and is not saturable. Water-soluble medications struggle to permeate lipid membranes, but highly lipid-soluble pharmaceuticals also diffuse poorly due to their insol- ubility in bodily \ufb02uids. It is easier for drugs with molecular weights between 100 and 400 Da to diffuse than for bigger molecules. Diffusion is enhanced by thin membranes and large surface areas, such as those seen in the lungs and intestine. Fundamentals of Pharmacokinetics and Drug Delivery 33 Fig. 2 Flowchart of methods by which drugs move across the plasma membrane When taking into account variables like concentration gradient, diffusion coef\ufb01cient, lipid solubility, surface area, and membrane thickness, Fick\u2019s \ufb01rst law of diffusion provides the best description of the passive diffusion of drug molecules over a biological membrane. Where, C1 is the higher concentration, C2 is the lower concentra- tion, and the difference (C1 - C2) represents the concentration gradient across the membrane. A is the membrane\u2019s surface area, D is the drug\u2019s diffusion coef\ufb01cient, Km/w is the lipid-water parti- tion coef\ufb01cient, and T is the membrane thickness. The percentage of drug ionized at a particular pH in bodily \ufb02uids and the ratio of ionized to unionized drug are found using the Henderson-Hassel Balch equation: For weak acidic drug pKa - pH = log of concentration of unionized drug =concentration of ionized drug %ionized drug = 100=1 \u00fe antilog pKa - pH \u00f0 \u00de", "using the Henderson-Hassel Balch equation: For weak acidic drug pKa - pH = log of concentration of unionized drug =concentration of ionized drug %ionized drug = 100=1 \u00fe antilog pKa - pH \u00f0 \u00de", "34 Asha et al. For weak basic drug pH - pKa = log of concentration of unionized drug =concentration of ionized drug %ionized drug = 100=1 \u00fe antilog pH - pKa \u00f0 \u00de B. Filtration Drugs are \ufb01ltered when they pass through membrane channels or pores as a result of osmotic pressure variations or hydrostatic pressure. It mostly affects passive transport-related small molecules (Mol. wt. <100). It is crucial for the renal excretion (glomerular \ufb01ltration) and medication elimination from cerebrospinal \ufb02uid, albeit less signi\ufb01cant for the majority of medicines. 3.1.2 Specialized Transport A. Active Transport Solutes require carriers, typically membrane proteins, in the energy-dependent process of active transport, which allows them to move against the concentration gradient (from lower to higher concentration). Because carriers only transfer medications with particular chemical structures, this mechanism is energy-intensive and structure-speci\ufb01c. The process can become saturated since there are only so many carriers, particularly at high drug concentra- tions where medicines with similar structures may compete for the same carriers. For large hydrophilic, polar, or electrolyte com- pounds like methyldopa, L-dopa, and several antimetabolites, active transport is essential. It is also essential for the excretion of some medications from the central nervous system and for renal and biliary excretion. There are two categories of active transport: primary and sec- ondary. In primary active transport, a carrier moves against the concentration gradient of a single material by utilizing the energy from ATP hydrolysis. A driving solute (such as Na, K, or Ca) and a substrate share a carrier in secondary active transport. The driving solute uses the electrochemical gradient produced by cell en", "gradient of a single material by utilizing the energy from ATP hydrolysis. A driving solute (such as Na, K, or Ca) and a substrate share a carrier in secondary active transport. The driving solute uses the electrochemical gradient produced by cell energy to propel the substrate\u2019s movement. Co-transport (symport) is the term used when both move in the same direction; counter- transport (antiport) is the term used when they move in opposite directions. Drugs are less dependent on secondary active transport than ions and nutrients (Table 1). B. Facilitated Diffusion A carrier-mediated transport mechanism called \u201cfacilitated dif- fusion\u201d transfers materials downward, following their concentra- tion gradient, without requiring energy. The concentration", "gradient drives the passive process of membrane crossing even though a carrier helps. It can move materials that cannot disperse on their own and is quicker than ordinary diffusion. It is structure- speci\ufb01c, saturable, and competitive with other agents of a similar nature to active transport. Nevertheless, unlike the symports and antiports of active transport, assisted diffusion uses uniports, which only move a single molecule at a time. Examples include the uptake of speci\ufb01c vitamins and the entrance of glucose into red blood cells. One of the less important drug transport mechanisms is facilitated diffusion.

Pinocytosis A small transport process called pinocytosis forms extracellular drug droplets into vesicles by engul\ufb01ng them in a section of the cell membrane. The vesicles are subsequently internalized and trans- ferred between cell membranes. Phagocytosis and this process are comparable; however, liquid droplets are used in place of solid particles. Sometimes, endocytosis is used to refer to both processes. In addition to having competitive saturation kinetics and some structural selectivity", "gocytosis and this process are comparable; however, liquid droplets are used in place of solid particles. Sometimes, endocytosis is used to refer to both processes. In addition to having competitive saturation kinetics and some structural selectivity, pinocytosis consumes cellular energy. It is in charge of taking in big proteins, some medications, such as insulin, and macromolecular nutrients. It also absorbs vaccines, like the Sabin Polio vaccine.", "36 Asha et al. 4 Routes of Drug Administration There are several ways to administer drugs, and each has pros and cons of its own [15]. 4.1 Oral (Enteral) Versus Parenteral Administration \u2022 Oral administration is the most popular and practical approach. Although it has bene\ufb01ts like cost-effectiveness and safety, food, digestive enzymes, and medication solubility may impede its absorption. Although controlled-release formulations may result in patient variability, they can enhance drug absorption. When oral delivery is not possible, there are several routes that allow faster absorption or avoid the liver\u2019s \ufb01rst-pass effect: sub- lingual and rectal. \u2022 When oral administration is not an option or is an emergency, peripheral administration (injection) provides quick, accurate drug delivery. Risks associated with intravenous injections include possible responses and the dose\u2019s irreversibility, but they also provide regulated, immediate effects and avoid pro- blems with absorption. Subcutaneous and intramuscular injec- tions are two other parenteral techniques that provide slower, persistent absorption. Moreover, speci\ufb01c organs or tissues can be targeted with intrathecal, topical, intraarterial, and pulmonary applications. Depending on the substance and circumstance, each approach has advantages and disadvantages. 4.2 Various Routes of Drug Administration 1. Oral (enteral) administration is the most common, conve- nient, and economical method, being noninvasive and easy for self-administration. However, absorption can be inconsis- tent due to factors like food, enzymes, or pH and \ufb01rst-pass metabolism in the liver can reduce drug ef\ufb01cacy. It\u2019s also unsuitable for patients who are vomiting or unconscious. 2. Sublingual administration provides rapid absorption directly into the b", "tent due to factors like food, enzymes, or pH and \ufb01rst-pass metabolism in the liver can reduce drug ef\ufb01cacy. It\u2019s also unsuitable for patients who are vomiting or unconscious. 2. Sublingual administration provides rapid absorption directly into the bloodstream, bypassing \ufb01rst-pass metabolism, but it is limited to small doses and certain drugs. 3. Rectal administration is useful for patients who can\u2019t take drugs orally and partially bypasses \ufb01rst-pass metabolism, though absorption can be irregular and may irritate the rectal mucosa. 4. Intravenous (IV) administration ensures immediate and com- plete bioavailability, allowing controlled and accurate drug delivery, but it requires aseptic conditions and skilled adminis- tration, with risks of infection, rapid adverse reactions, and irreversibility once the drug is administered. 5. Intramuscular (IM) injections offer rapid absorption for aque- ous solutions and sustained release for depot formulations, though they may cause pain, tissue damage, and slower absorp- tion in obese individuals, with a risk of accidental injection into blood vessels.", "Fundamentals of Pharmacokinetics and Drug Delivery 37 6. Subcutaneous (SC) injections provide slower, sustained drug release and are less invasive than IV or IM routes, but they are limited to non-irritating drugs and can be painful, with a restricted volume of administration. 7. Inhalation offers rapid absorption due to the large lung surface area and is ideal for local delivery to the lungs, such as in asthma treatment, but it requires proper technique and dose control can be challenging. 8. Topical administration provides localized effects, minimizing systemic side effects, with transdermal patches offering con- trolled, sustained release, though absorption is slow through intact skin and limited to lipid-soluble drugs. 9. Intrathecal administration delivers drugs directly into the cere- brospinal \ufb02uid (CSF), bypassing the blood\u2013brain barrier, which is useful for spinal anesthesia or CNS infections, but it requires expert administration and carries a high risk of complications. 10. Intraarterial administration targets speci\ufb01c organs or tissues, such as in treating liver tumors, but it is technically challenging and risky, with potential for local tissue damage. Each route has speci\ufb01c bene\ufb01ts based on the drug and the patient\u2019s condition, but they also come with inherent limita- tions and risks. 5 Absorption The process by which an unaltered medication enters the blood- stream from the place of administration is known as absorption. Drug absorption is necessary for all systemic routes, with the exception of intravascular ones, in order for the medication to reach its target in the circulation and start working. The effective- ness of a medicine is dependent on its pace and degree of absorp- tion; a drug that absorbs slowly may not reach its minimal effective concentra", "nes, in order for the medication to reach its target in the circulation and start working. The effective- ness of a medicine is dependent on its pace and degree of absorp- tion; a drug that absorbs slowly may not reach its minimal effective concentration, whereas a substance that absorbs quickly may attain therapeutic levels quite soon. Drugs must dissolve in bodily \ufb02uids in solid forms, such as powders, capsules, and tablets, in order for them to be absorbed, regardless of the mode of administration [2]. 5.1 Factors Affecting Absorption of Drugs Several factors affect the rate and degree of medication absorption. 5.1.1 Physio-chemical Characteristics Absorption is in\ufb02uenced by molecule size, pK, and lipid solubility. Drugs that are unionized and lipid-soluble are absorbed more quickly.", "38 Asha et al. 5.1.2 Dosage Form Compared to oily, suspension, or solid forms, drugs in aqueous solutions are absorbed more quickly. Absorption is also in\ufb02uenced by the rate of dissolution; liquids often absorb more quickly than pills or sustained-release goods. 5.1.3 Concentration and Volume A steeper concentration gradient causes higher drug concentrations and quantities to be absorbed more quickly. 5.1.4 Blood Flow By preserving the concentration gradient, improved blood \ufb02ow to the absorption site improves medication absorption. 5.1.5 Surface Area Faster absorption is achieved by larger absorbent surfaces, such as the intestine as opposed to the stomach. 5.1.6 Administration Route Different routes have different rates of absorption; pulmonary and intramuscular (IM) routes absorb drugs more quickly than subcu- taneous (SC) or oral methods. 5.1.7 Disease States By changing pH, membrane permeability, or blood \ufb02ow, illnesses such acid-base imbalances, infections, and cardiovascular disorders can have an impact on absorption. 5.2 Gastrointestinal Tract For systemic medications, the oral route is frequently used. Drugs enter the stomach through the esophagus and mouth after con- sumption. Although absorption is supported by the abundant blood supply and thin epithelium of the oral mucosa, signi\ufb01cant absorption is limited by the mouth\u2019s brief period of contact. Because of its quick passage time, the esophagus does not absorb medicines either. The gastrointestinal (GI) tract\u2019s epithelial lining serves as the primary barrier. According to the pH-partition hypothesis, acidic medications are better absorbed in the stomach and basic pharmaceuticals in the intestine. Lipid-soluble and unionized drugs are absorbed by diffusion. The majority of medi- cations are instead absorbed in", "rding to the pH-partition hypothesis, acidic medications are better absorbed in the stomach and basic pharmaceuticals in the intestine. Lipid-soluble and unionized drugs are absorbed by diffusion. The majority of medi- cations are instead absorbed in the intestine, which has a big surface area and ideal circumstances, whereas stomach absorption is restricted by the thick gastric mucosa and small surface area [5]. Food can slow down and dilute absorption in the GI tract. While digestive juices aid in the dissolution of medications, they can also render certain inactive (such as insulin and penicillin-G). Reduction of absorption can also occur from drug metabolism by gut bacteria or enzymes. While high intestinal motility can reduce absorption, rapid gastric emptying often improves it. Drugs taken concurrently may have an impact on absorption and varying reac- tions may result from variables such as drug size, dosage form, GI tract variations, and pathological states.", "Fundamentals of Pharmacokinetics and Drug Delivery 39 5.3 Parenteral Sites Because medicines are placed close to capillaries, absorption from intramuscular (IM) and subcutaneous (SC) locations is typically rapid. Due to the porosity of the capillaries, even big lipid-insoluble or ionized medicines are absorbed, whereas lipid-soluble medica- tions readily pass through the capillary endothelium. Most sub- stances that are more than 20,000 Da reach the lymphatic system. IM medication absorption happens quickly\u2014typically in 10 to 30 minutes, depending on blood \ufb02ow. Because there is less blood \ufb02ow, SC absorption is slower, which is useful for depot preparations. Vasoconstrictors such as adrenaline slow down SC absorption; however, hyaluronidase can increase it by spreading the medication. Heat, massage, or exercise can increase blood \ufb02ow to the injection site and speed up absorption; cooling, immo- bility, or the use of a tourniquet slows it down. 5.4 Pulmonary Sites (Alveoli) Aerosols and volatile anesthetics are two examples of drugs that are rapidly absorbed when inhaled. Because of their tiny molecular size, high lipid-to-water ratio, vast surface area, and high permeability of the alveoli, volatile anesthetics are rapidly absorbed. Particle size is important for aerosols because smaller particles enter the lungs deeper and are quickly absorbed from the alveoli, while bigger particles remain in the upper respiratory tract. 5.5 Topical Sites Although the main purpose of topical medicine administration is to cause local effects, some medications can also have systemic effects by being absorbed through the skin or mucous membranes. Lipid solubility is the primary factor that determines systemic absorption from topical administration; medicines that are insoluble in lipids u", ", some medications can also have systemic effects by being absorbed through the skin or mucous membranes. Lipid solubility is the primary factor that determines systemic absorption from topical administration; medicines that are insoluble in lipids usually penetrate poorly. The keratinized epidermis of the skin serves as a barrier, yet rubbing, occlusive dressings, or iontophore- sis can improve absorption. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is one solvent that can help with penetration. Skin injury or in\ufb02ammatory disorders might also increase absorption. Due to their thinness and high vascular density, mucous membranes typically absorb drugs more quickly than the skin, but this can occasionally result in unfavorable systemic side effects. 6 Distribution The process by which medications enter extravascular \ufb02uids and tissues and leave the bloodstream is known as distribution. This critical pharmacokinetic phase affects not only the organs involved in metabolism and excretion but also the way that medicines reach their target areas [6].", "40 Asha et al. 6.1 Factors Affecting Distribution of Drugs 6.1.1 Physicochemical Properties of the Drug Except in the CNS, drugs with molecular weights less than 500\u2013600 Da typically pass-through capillary membranes with ease. Their mobility from extracellular \ufb02uids into cells is contingent upon their molecular size, lipophilicity, and ionization. The pH-partition hypothesis states that whereas acidic medications concentrate in alkaline \ufb02uids, basic pharmaceuticals reach acidic tissues and \ufb02uids (where they become ionized and con\ufb01ned). 6.1.2 Binding to Plasma and Tissue Proteins Medications in blood can either be free or attached to plasma proteins. Free medications can be metabolized and eliminated, are diffusible and have pharmacological activity. Because of their increased size, bound medicines are inert, cannot disperse, and cannot be metabolized or excreted. If the concentration of a drug in a tissue is greater than that of the plasma, it is said to be localized in that tissue [8]. For example, tetracyclines can build up in dental tissues during a child\u2019s or infant\u2019s tooth development, causing the teeth to permanently discolor from brown to yellow. 6.1.3 Blood Flow and Organ Size The size and blood \ufb02ow rate of the organs determine how drugs are distributed to them. Lipid-soluble medications quickly equilibrate in highly perfused organs such as the brain, kidneys, liver, heart, adrenal glands, and lungs. The equilibration process takes longer for tissues with moderate perfusion, such as muscle and skin, and even longer for tissues with poor perfusion, including adipose tissue, bones, and teeth. 6.1.4 Specialized Compartments and Barriers \u2022 Blood\u2013Brain Barrier (BBB): Endothelial cells and the astrocyte- covered basement membrane that serve as protection form the BBB\u2019", "or tissues with poor perfusion, including adipose tissue, bones, and teeth. 6.1.4 Specialized Compartments and Barriers \u2022 Blood\u2013Brain Barrier (BBB): Endothelial cells and the astrocyte- covered basement membrane that serve as protection form the BBB\u2019s tight connections. Generally speaking, it permits lipid- soluble medications to pass through while polar or ionized medications do not. Speci\ufb01c carriers are used to carry some medications and endogenous compounds, and some parts of the brain can \ufb02ow through the blood-brain barrier. Older people and neonates are less effective at using the barrier. \u2022 Blood-Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Barrier: This barrier, which is made up of the choroid plexus, features tight connections between choroidal cells but open junctions between capillary endothelial cells. Lipid-soluble medications can pass through it and into the CSF, but because CSF is always \ufb02owing, drug concentrations in the CSF are often lower than in the brain. \u2022 Placental Barrier: Similar to the BBB, the placental barrier is made up of trophoblastic cells. Water-soluble medications use carrier-mediated transport, whereas lipid-soluble medications pass easily. Certain lipid-insoluble medications may only pass in small quantities, particularly if they are present for long periods of time or in high concentrations. Compared to the BBB, the barrier is less restrictive.", "Fundamentals of Pharmacokinetics and Drug Delivery 41 \u2022 Other Barriers: Drug penetration is restricted by structures such as the eyes, testicles, and prostate. Moreover, drugs have restricted access to middle ear \ufb02uid, bronchial secretions, and pericardial \ufb02uid. Compared to water-soluble medicines, lipid- soluble medications are more easily absorbed into these tissues. 6.1.5 Specialized Transport Systems Certain medications are actively absorbed by specialized transport mechanisms, resulting in concentration in particular tissues. Thy- roid cells, for instance, actively absorb iodine [11]. 6.1.6 Disease States Drug distribution can be affected by diseases. For example, the blood\u2013brain barrier becomes more porous in meningitis and encephalitis, which makes it possible for polar antibiotics such as penicillin-G to enter the brain. Reduced plasma protein binding in hypoalbuminemia may result in elevated amounts of free medications. 6.1.7 Physiological Factors Because of their immature brains and increased cerebral blood \ufb02ow, babies have more drug penetration into the brain. Drug distribu- tion in older people is impacted by decreased blood\u2013brain barrier effectiveness and decreased protein levels. Despite modest perfu- sion rates, obesity can lead to the accumulation of lipophilic med- icines in adipose tissue [13]. Due to the expanding uterus, placenta, and fetus during pregnancy, the volume of distribution increases, forming a distinct compartment for the distribution of drugs. 7 Metabolism/Biotransformation The process of changing a substance\u2019s chemical form to one that is more water soluble for simpler excretion is called metabolism. Particularly, \u201cbiotransformation\u201cdescribes the molecular altera- tions that foreign substances go through in the body. The term \u201cmetabolis", "nging a substance\u2019s chemical form to one that is more water soluble for simpler excretion is called metabolism. Particularly, \u201cbiotransformation\u201cdescribes the molecular altera- tions that foreign substances go through in the body. The term \u201cmetabolism\u201cis more general and encompasses changes to endog- enous molecules like as proteins and lipids as well as xenobiotics [7]. 7.1 Functions of Metabolism 1. Inactivation: Converts active drugs to inactive forms (e.g., phenobarbital, morphine). 2. Bioactivation: Converts drugs to more active forms (e.g., codeine, isoniazid). 3. Pharmacological Activation: Converts inactive pro-drugs to active forms (e.g., enalapril, levodopa). 4. No Change: Converts active drugs to equally active forms (e.g., diazepam, digitoxin). 5. Change in Activity: Converts active drugs to metabolites with different pharmacological effects (e.g., iproniazid).", "42 Asha et al. 7.2 Sites of Metabolism All bodily tissues have some level of metabolic activity, but the liver is the primary location for drug metabolism because it has a large number of metabolizing enzymes. Because there are fewer enzymes in other organs, extra-hepatic metabolism is less relevant. While some drug metabolism does occur in the nuclear envelope, plasma membrane, and mitochondria, the majority of it takes place in the cytosol and smooth endoplasmic reticulum. There is additional non-enzymatic metabolism, such as the spontaneous decomposi- tion of atracurium in plasma [9]. 7.3 Drug- Metabolizing Enzymes Drug-metabolizing enzymes are classi\ufb01ed into two types. 7.3.1 Microsomal Enzymes These enzymes, which are present in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum of the liver and other tissues, are essential for the majority of oxidative processes, some reductive and hydrolytic reactions, and glucuronide conjugation. Glucuronyl transferase and mono- oxygenases are two examples. 7.3.2 Non-microsomal Enzymes These enzymes, which are found in the cytoplasm, mitochondria, bodily \ufb02uids, and other tissues, participate in all conjugative reac- tions other than glucuronidation and carry out more reductive, hydrolytic, and oxidative reactions. 7.4 Pathways of Biotransformation Drug biotransformation occurs in two major phases. 1. Phase I: These enzymes participate in all conjugative reactions except glucuronidation and perform additional reductive, hydrolytic, and oxidative reactions. They are present in the cytoplasm, mitochondria, body \ufb02uids, and other organs. 2. Phase II: involves conjugation, which is the process by which medicines or their Phase I metabolites are joined to polar endogenous molecules (such as glucuronic acid or sulfate). This step results in readily excret", ", body \ufb02uids, and other organs. 2. Phase II: involves conjugation, which is the process by which medicines or their Phase I metabolites are joined to polar endogenous molecules (such as glucuronic acid or sulfate). This step results in readily excreted conjugates that are soluble in water. Phase II typically results in the drug being inactive, but Phase I may cause no change, inactivation, or bioactivation. While some medicines go through both phases, others might only go through one. Through these processes, a single medication can create sev- eral metabolites [14]. 8 Excretion The process of permanently eliminating medications and their metabolites from the body is called excretion. Water-soluble and ionized compounds are excreted more readily by excretory", "organs\u2014apart from the lungs\u2014than lipid-soluble ones, which must \ufb01rst be converted into water-soluble forms in order to be excreted more easily. Fundamentals of Pharmacokinetics and Drug Delivery 43 8.1 Routes of Excretion Drugs are removed from the body by a variety of pathways, includ- ing the kidneys, lungs, bile, and intestines, either unaltered or as metabolites. Renal excretion is the word used to describe elimina- tion via the kidneys; extra-renal or non-renal excretion is the term used to describe elimination through other organs. 8.1.1 Renal Excretion of Drugs The main method of drug removal, particularly for tiny, non-volatile, water-soluble compounds, is renal excretion. Tubular secretion, tubular reabsorption, and glomerular \ufb01ltration are the three mechanisms involved. A. Glomerular \ufb01ltration: Drugs that are not protein-bound are non-selectively \ufb01ltered into renal tubules through glomerular \ufb01ltration, which is fueled by the hydrostatic pressure of blood. B. Tubular secretion: Relying on renal blood \ufb02ow, tubular secre- tion actively moves some medications from blood to the tubu- lar lumen, independent of concentration gradients. C. Tubular reabsorption: Tubular reabsorption, which happens passively for lipid-soluble medications or actively for some endogenous compounds, brings medications from the tubular \ufb02uid back into the bloodstream and prolongs their half-lives. 8.1.2 Extra-Renal Excretion of Drugs A. Biliary excretion: Through bile, drugs and their metabolites are eliminated, primarily by active processes. Large molecules and highly polar, water-soluble conjugates are expelled more easily. B. Pulmonary excretion: Diffusion is how gases and volatile substances\u2014such as inhalation anesthetics\u2014are expelled from the body through the lungs. The solubility, bloo", "ge molecules and highly polar, water-soluble conjugates are expelled more easily. B. Pulmonary excretion: Diffusion is how gases and volatile substances\u2014such as inhalation anesthetics\u2014are expelled from the body through the lungs. The solubility, blood \ufb02ow, and respiration all affect the rate at which lipid-soluble medications leave the body unaltered. C. Mammary excretion: Medicines can enter milk through a small opening and impact breastfeeding babies; weakly basic medi- cines concentrate more because of the acidity of milk. Drugs that are lipophilic can attach to milk fat. D. Salivary excretion: Certain drugs can enter saliva through active secretion, although most enter through passive diffu- sion. Saliva excretion in ruminants might upset the microbiota in the rumen. E. Gastrointestinal excretion: Drugs can enter the GI system from blood and then be recycled or eliminated in feces, commonly following parenteral delivery.", "44 Asha et al. F. Other excretion routes: Sweat, tears, and other \ufb02uids contain trace amounts of drug residue. It is possible to \ufb01nd certain heavy metals in nails and hair. An alternate method is to utilize particular pharmacokinetic principles to examine plasma drug concentration\u2013time data in order to explore the rate and extent of individual pharmacokinetic parameters, as this is a complex process. 9 Plasma Drug Concentration\u2013Time Pro\ufb01le A drug\u2019s concentration at the site of action determines the start, strength, and duration of its effects. Since it is dif\ufb01cult to take direct tissue samples, plasma drug levels are taken as a rough estimate. Plotting the drug concentrations against time (X-axis) and measur- ing the drug levels in plasma (Y-axis) at different times results in the plasma drug concentration\u2013time curve [10]. A medication that is given orally or through an extravascular route (IM, SC, IP, etc.) enters the bloodstream gradually and raises the plasma drug concentration until it reaches a peak. The medica- tion is transported to tissues and removed during absorption. The absorption phase, where absorption exceeds distribution and elimi- nation, is represented by the ascending portion of the curve pre- ceding the peak. The elimination phase, in which elimination surpasses absorption, is represented by the descending section that follows the apex. The rates of absorption (Ka) and elimination (\u1e9e) are shown by the slopes of these phases, respectively (Fig. 3). 9.1 Minimum Effective Concentration (MEC) MEC is the minimum plasma drug concentration required to achieve a therapeutic outcome. The smallest concentration needed to impede microbiological growth is known as the smallest inhibi- tory concentration (MIC) for antimicrobial medications. 9.2 Maximum Safe Conce", "um plasma drug concentration required to achieve a therapeutic outcome. The smallest concentration needed to impede microbiological growth is known as the smallest inhibi- tory concentration (MIC) for antimicrobial medications. 9.2 Maximum Safe Concentration (MSC) or Minimum Toxic Concentration (MTC) MSC or MTC is the plasma concentration at which a medication starts to have harmful effects. Between MEC and MSC is where the therapeutic range is located. 9.3 Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax or Cpmax) The dose, absorption rate (Ka), and elimination rate (\u03b2) all work together to determine the maximum drug concentration in plasma. When the rates of absorption and elimination are equal, it happens. 9.4 Area Under the Curve (AUC) AUC is the entire area under the plasma concentration\u2013time curve, which shows how much medication has entered the systemic circu- lation overall.", "Fundamentals of Pharmacokinetics and Drug Delivery 45 Fig. 3 Plasma drug concentration\u2013time pro\ufb01le after oral administration of a single dose of a drug. Abbreviation: Cmax maximum/peak plasma concentration, MEC minimum effective-concentration; MSE maximum safe concentration; tmax time of peak concentration; AUC area under-curve; K2 absorption rate constant: elimination rate constant 9.5 Peak Effect Peak effect is the maximum pharmacological reaction that a medi- cation can produce; this is usually seen at peak plasma concentration. 9.6 Time to Maximum Concentration (tmax) The duration required for a medication to attain its maximum plasma concentration. For medications treating acute illnesses, a shorter half-life (tmax) is achieved through faster absorption. 9.7 Onset of Action When a drug\u2019s plasma concentration surpasses the MEC, the phar- macological impact of the medication begins. 9.8 Onset Time The amount of time that a medication takes to reach the MEC and start having a pharmacological impact. 9.9 Duration of Action The length of time a medication exerts its pharmacological effect, typically corresponding to the period when its plasma concentra- tion stays above the minimum effective concentration (MEC). 10 Order of Pharmacokinetic Processes The drug\u2019s concentration in the body in\ufb02uences pharmacokinetic processes (ADME); the way this concentration impacts the process pace is known as the process order. First-order, mixed-order, and zero-order processes are the three primary categories.", "46 Asha et al. 10.1 Zero-Order Kinetics The process\u2019s rate is \ufb01xed and independent of the drug\u2019s concen- tration. Each unit of time processes a speci\ufb01c amount of drug, and the half-life changes with drug concentration. This happens with medications like alcohol and phenytoin, as well as in carrier- mediated processes when they are saturated. 10.2 First-Order Kinetics A \ufb01xed percentage of the medication is metabolized over time because the rate depends on the drug concentration. Most medica- tions follow \ufb01rst-order kinetics, where the half-life remains constant regardless of concentration 10.3 Mixed-Order Kinetics This combines \ufb01rst- and zero-order kinetics. The drug exhibits \ufb01rst-order kinetics at low doses; however, as concentrations increase, carrier or enzyme saturation causes the drug\u2019s kinetics to shift to zero order. This is shown in medications such as ribo\ufb02avin, naproxen, and vitamin C. 11 Pharmacokinetic Models The body moves drugs in a complex way, involving many pharma- cokinetic processes (ADME) going on at once. Pharmacokinetic models have been developed as a result of assumptions made about drug movement in an attempt to simplify and explain these over- lapping occurrences. These models provide a means of computing important pharmacokinetic parameters and expressing the tempo- ral course of medications in the body mathematically. Physiological models, non-compartmental models, and compartmental models are the three primary models utilized in drug analysis [4]. 11.1 Compartmental Models The conventional and extensively utilized approach for describing drug pharmacokinetics is compartmental analysis. According to this method, the body is separated into sections that can converse with one another in both directions. Organs, tissues, and bodily \ufb02uids can const", "nsively utilized approach for describing drug pharmacokinetics is compartmental analysis. According to this method, the body is separated into sections that can converse with one another in both directions. Organs, tissues, and bodily \ufb02uids can constitute multiple compartments; hence, tissues that share a similar medication distribution pattern are combined into a single hypothetical compartment. These compartments are mathematical creations without physiological or anatomical meaning. Since most medications can \ufb02ow freely between compartments, one-, two-, or three-compartment models\u2014also known as open models\u2014are typ- ically employed to explain most drugs. Drug transport and elimi- nation are thought to occur according to \ufb01rst-order kinetics. 11.1.1 One- Compartment Open Model The simplest pharmacokinetic model is the one-compartment open model, which treats the body as a single homogenous unit. The medication distribution across bodily \ufb02uids and plasma in this model reaches equilibrium instantaneously and stays constant. Modi\ufb01cations in tissue concentrations are directly re\ufb02ected in", "variations in plasma drug levels. Whether a drug is given intrave- nously as a bolus or extra vascularly, this model describes the plasma levels following a single dose and is applicable to pharmaceuticals that distribute quickly throughout the body. Fundamentals of Pharmacokinetics and Drug Delivery 47 A. Intravenous bolus administration: When a medicine is admi- nistered intravenously as a bolus, the whole dose enters circu- lation and reaches tissues promptly. On semi-logarithmic paper, the resulting drug concentration\u2013time curve displays a monophasic exponential decline and is a straight line. The drop is a re\ufb02ection of the elimination phase\u2014also known as drug elimination. Since the distribution phase happens too quickly to show on the graph, it is usually ignored. The drug concen- tration at time zero is represented by the zero-time intercept, and the slope of the line indicates the elimination rate constant. B. Extravascular administration: When administering drugs extravascularly (by mouth, intramuscular injection, or subcu- taneous injection), the drug must be absorbed before entering the bloodstream. Two exponents\u2014one for absorption (Ka) and one for elimination (\u1e9e)\u2014describe the change in drug concentration over time for medications that adhere to the one-compartment model. 11.1.2 Two- Compartment Open Model The body is divided into a central compartment, which contains blood; a peripheral compartment, which contains less perfused tissues like skin, muscles, and bone; and a central compartment, which contains highly perfused organs like liver, kidneys, lungs, heart, and brain. Medications are injected or absorbed into the central compartment, which quickly comes into equilibrium with the organs within. While distribution between the central and peripheral compar", "perfused organs like liver, kidneys, lungs, heart, and brain. Medications are injected or absorbed into the central compartment, which quickly comes into equilibrium with the organs within. While distribution between the central and peripheral compartments happens slowly and is controlled by \ufb01rst-order rate constants (k12 for movement from central to peripheral and k21 for the opposite), elimination only occurs from the central compartment. A. Intravenous bolus administration: When an intravenous bolus is administered, the plasma drug concentration in a two-compartment model decreases biexponentially. Distribu- tion causes a sharp initial decline (central to peripheral), while elimination causes a delayed terminal fall. The elimination phase is the phase for the curve\u2019s terminal linear portion. The residuals method (feathering technique) can be used to com- pute the initial drug concentration (C0), as well as the rate constants for distribution (\u03b1) and elimination (\u03b2). B. Extravascular administration: The three rate constants in this model that describe changes in plasma drug concentration during extravascular administration are Ka (absorption), \u03b1 (distribution), and \u03b2 (elimination).", "48 Asha et al. 11.1.3 Three- Compartment Open Model The three-compartment open model provides the best explanation for the pharmacokinetics of medications that undergo redistribu- tion or have a strong af\ufb01nity for particular tissues. Three compart- ments make up the body in this model: two peripheral compartments, one containing moderately perfused tissues (like muscles and skin) and the other containing poorly perfused tissues (like bone, teeth, fat, and hair). The central compartment contains the plasma and highly perfused organs. The drug \ufb01rst spreads swiftly into the central compartment following an intravenous bolus injection, then more slowly into the tissues with moderate perfusion, and \ufb01nally very slowly into the tissues with poor perfu- sion. A triexponential curve appears when the plasma concentration-time pro\ufb01le is displayed. 11.2 Non- compartmental Models/Non- compartmental Analysis Another technique for examining the duration of drug exposure in the body without supposing a particular compartmental model is non-compartment analysis. It uses simple algebraic equations to compute pharmacokinetic parameters and treats the drug concentration\u2013time pro\ufb01le in plasma as a statistical distribution. This method does not call for in-depth analyses of drug disposition. The fact that it frequently concentrates on averages and provides little information about the entire plasma drug concentration\u2013time pro\ufb01le is a disadvantage. 11.3 Physiological Models Perfusion rate-limited models, another name for physiological models, are a more recent method of examining how drugs behave in the body. This approach treats each target site and major organ system as a separate physiological compartment with its own tissue volume, blood \ufb02ow, drug af\ufb01nity (partition coef\ufb01cient), uptake me", "a more recent method of examining how drugs behave in the body. This approach treats each target site and major organ system as a separate physiological compartment with its own tissue volume, blood \ufb02ow, drug af\ufb01nity (partition coef\ufb01cient), uptake mechanism, and elimination process. Drug kinetics are expressed in terms of \ufb02ow-related equations that combine experimental esti- mates (such as tissue-to-plasma partition coef\ufb01cients) with known physiological data (such as organ volume and blood \ufb02ow) (Fig. 4). These models provide a more accurate representation of medi- cation distribution in different organs since they are grounded in actual anatomical and physiological data. They can also predict species differences based on perfusion rates and enable the evalua- tion of how physiological changes (e.g., aging) or diseases affect medication disposition. The main disadvantage is that it takes a lot of work to collect the required experimental data. 12 Determinants of Pharmacokinetics 12.1 Absorption 12.1.1 Bioavailability The percentage (F) of a medicine that, following delivery, enters the bloodstream in its unaltered chemical state is known as its bioavailability. A drug\u2019s bioavailability is 100% (F = 1) when admi- nistered intravenously, and it is typically very nearly 100% when", "administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously. The bioavailability of medications taken orally can range from 0% to 100%, contingent on the extent of absorption and the in\ufb02uence of \ufb01rst-pass metabo- lism. Oral medications that are slowly absorbed or have limited water solubility frequently have poor bioavailability. Additionally, drugs with a high \ufb01rst-pass metabolism typically have a limited bioavailability. For this reason, the word \u201cbioavailability\u201cis more pertinent when referring to oral delivery than when referring to other routes. It\u2019s regarded as an absolute measurement [12]. Fundamentals of Pharmacokinetics and Drug Delivery 49 Fig. 4 An illustration of a physiologically grounded pharmacokinetic model that incorporates the kidney, liver, gut, brain, and other tissues. The organ is indicated by the subscript and the word Q denotes the blood \ufb02ow By comparing the area under the plasma concentration\u2013time curve (AUC) following oral or other non-vascular delivery with the AUC following intravenous (IV) treatment, which signi\ufb01es 100% bioavailability (F = 1), one can ascertain absolute bioavailability. Bioavailability oral \u00f0 \u00de = AUCoral \u00d7 100=AUCIV or F = AUCoral=AUC IV 100% is the bioavailability if both AUCs are equal. This metric aids in the prediction of medication ef\ufb01cacy for various dosage forms or methods of administration. Parenteral > oral > topical is normally the sequence in which bioavailability occurs. Drug absorption-related factors also impact the drug\u2019s bioavailability. Relative bioavailability F stands for relative bioavailability, which is the systemic availability of a medicine\u2019s formulation compared to an oral standard of the same drug.", "relative bioavailability, which is the systemic availability of a medicine\u2019s formulation compared to an oral standard of the same drug.", "50 Asha et al. 12.1.2 Bioequivalence When two identical medications or distinct formulations achieve their peak blood concentrations simultaneously and have compara- ble bioavailability, this is known as bioequivalency. This indicates that when given in the same dosage range, they result in compara- ble therapeutic and side effects since they produce equivalent drug concentrations in plasma and tissues. The medications or formula- tions are deemed bioinequivalent if there is a notable variation in their bioavailability. 12.1.3 Area Under Curve (AUC) The entire area under the plasma drug concentration\u2013time curve, or area under the curve (AUC), shows how much of the drug enters the systemic circulation overall after injection. It is a crucial metric for evaluating a medication\u2019s bioavailability, which indicates the degree of absorption, and it is also used to compute different pharmacokinetic parameters. The formula for calculating the AUC is time multiplied by drug concentration (\u03bcg/ml \u00d7 hours). 12.2 Distribution 12.2.1 Volume of Distribution Assuming the body functions as a single, uniform compartment for the drug, the volume of distribution (Va) is the \ufb01ctitious volume of bodily \ufb02uid required to distribute the entire supplied drug to obtain the observed plasma concentration. Volume of distribution V \u00f0 \u00de = Amount of drug in body=Plasma drug concentration = Dose D \u00f0 \u00de =C 12.3 Elimination 12.3.1 Half-Life (t\u00bd) Elimination half-life, or half-life (t\u00bd), is the amount of time needed for the drug concentration in plasma to drop by 50%. It happens during the elimination phase and has an inverse relationship with the elimination rate constant (\u1e9e), i.e., a shorter half-life is obtained with faster elimination. It is stated in minutes or hours. It is deter- mined mathematically a", " 50%. It happens during the elimination phase and has an inverse relationship with the elimination rate constant (\u1e9e), i.e., a shorter half-life is obtained with faster elimination. It is stated in minutes or hours. It is deter- mined mathematically as follows: Half - life t 1 2 = In 2=\u03b2 = 0:693=\u03b2 The natural logarithm of two is represented as 0.693 in the equation. The B phase slope of the plasma drug concentration\u2013time curve can be used to calculate a medication\u2019s half-life. Furthermore, a certain formula can be used to determine the elimination half-life using clearance (Cl) and apparent volume of distribution (Vd). Half - life t 1 2 = 0:639:Vd=CI A drug\u2019s half-life is a measure of how long it takes to take effect and is directly related to how much of it is present at the site of action. A shorter half-life corresponds to a reduced concentration at the target site and a shorter duration. Setting dosage intervals and", "\ufb01guring out how long it takes to achieve steady state at a constant dose depend on it. Drugs with \ufb01rst-order kinetics have a dose- independent half-life, meaning that 95% of the drug is gone after around 5 half-lives. On the other hand, the half-life of medications with zero-order kinetics rises with dosage. Fundamentals of Pharmacokinetics and Drug Delivery 51 12.3.2 Clearance (Cl) or Body Clearance Body clearance, often known as clearance (Cl), is the amount of plasma that a medication is theoretically entirely cleared from in a certain amount of time. It can be adjusted for body weight (ml/kg/min) and is measured in volume per time (ml/min). The relationship between clearance and the rate of removal of a plasma medication is as follows: Body Clearance = Rate of Elimination=Plasma Drug Concentration It is also calculated as the product of the apparent volume of distribution (Vd) and the overall elimination rate constant (\u03b2): Body Clearance = 0:693 \u00d7 Vd=t1=2 The half-life of the drug is inversely correlated with clearance; that is, as clearance rises, the half-life falls. Nevertheless, as clearance also depends on the volume of distribution and elimination rate, a short half-life does not always imply good clearance. Compared to half-life, clearance is a more accurate indicator of elimination ef\ufb01- ciency because it captures the rate at which drugs are removed from the body without regard to distribution kinetics. It doesn\u2019t say how long a medicine stays in the body. 13 Conclusion A vital framework for comprehending the dynamic processes of medication absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion in a variety of animal species is provided by pharmacokinetics.

These active ingredients can more effectively produce the desired effects by utilizing targeted technologies of drug delivery [1]. Drug delivery tactics addresses the effective drug delivery methods and formulations that optimize clinical effects whereas reducing adverse effects [2]. The study of drug transpor- tation is expanding in the sphere of pharmacological science [3]. In contrast to conventional DDSs, which rely on drugs being absorbed through biological membranes, TDDS get area-speci\ufb01c release of pharmaceuticals from a dosage formulation [4]. The goal Abhishek Pathak and Satya Pal Singh (eds.), Next-Generation Drug Delivery Systems, Methods in Pharmacology and Toxicology, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-4554-3_3, \u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025 53", "of TDD is to regulate and control the dynamics and kinetics, immunogenicity, biorecognition, and a speci\ufb01c toxicity of pharma- ceuticals. The targeting of drugs may be accomplished through various methods such as enzyme mediation, pH-dependent release, and employing specialized carriers [5]. As transporters in present DDSs, nanoparticles have shown a great deal of promise. Now, it is possible to encapsulate the pharmaceuticals in a variety of nanopar- ticle shapes, such as dendrimers, micelles, liposomes, and solid lipid nanocarriers, to increase therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy and decrease unpleas- ant side effects [6]. With nanoparticle-based drug delivery, there is a chance for regulated drug release, giving enough time to pharma- ceutical producing response to particular stimulus like level of pH, heat, light or proteases and function with improved therapeutic effect [6]. In this chapter, the fundamental principles of drug targeting and a review of various strategies related to insoluble drug and tissue speci\ufb01c drug delivery will be discussed in detail. 54 Meemansha Sharma et al. 2 Principles of Targeted Drug Delivery TDD is a treatment approach designed to minimize exposure to healthy tissues while administering medication to a speci\ufb01ed target site within the body [7]. The fundamental idea behind drug aimed at speci\ufb01c target is to minimize the presence of drug in unintended areas while ensuring a concentrated delivery to the desired target [8]. This approach aims to diminish adverse effects stemming from dispersed concentrations in non-targeted regions, allowing for ele- vated doses, in addition to mitigating interactions with multiple targets. By doing so, this concept optimizes the therapeutic impact of the medication [9]. Furthermore, targeting diminishes unwanted interacti", " non-targeted regions, allowing for ele- vated doses, in addition to mitigating interactions with multiple targets. By doing so, this concept optimizes the therapeutic impact of the medication [9]. Furthermore, targeting diminishes unwanted interactions between the medication and biological fac- tors within the body, affecting drug distribution to particular ana- tomical sites, as shown in Fig. 1. These biological factors encompass blood circulation, tissue structure, chemical properties, and enzy- matic activity [10]. Drug targeting necessitates the synchronized interaction of drug, target site, and also the pharmaceutical carrier. The target refers to particular organ, cell, or cluster of cells, whether in a chronic/acute state requiring treatment, where the drug will act. The carrier is a purposefully designed molecule/system crucial for ef\ufb01ciently transporting the drug payload to predetermined loca- tions [11]. Ideally, a medication aimed at speci\ufb01c target should possess several characteristics: it should be non-toxic, non-immu- nogenic, chemically inert, capable of degradation over time, com- patible with biological systems, and maintain stability both within the body and in laboratory settings. Additionally, it should demon- strate a pattern of drug release that is predictable and can be controlled, be straightforward and consistent in its preparation,", "cost-effective, easily removed from body, and minimize drug seep- age while transportation [12]. Targeted Drug Delivery: Principles and Strategies 55 Fig. 1 The fundamental principles of targeted drug delivery The production of targeted pharmaceutics should consider the special qualities of target cells, additionally the features of the transport carriers/vehicles in charge of delivering drug to certain receptors to guarantee that these ideal qualities can be attained [13]. These signi\ufb01cant factors encompass the drug concentration, location and spread of particles, molecular size, chemical proper- ties, enzymatic activity, electric \ufb01eld, physiological conditions, type and also number of polymers or excipients, and the surface char- acteristics (including shape, charge, size, and density) of the carrier system. To achieve effective targeting of speci\ufb01c cells or tissues, it\u2019s crucial to manage physiological factors like blood circulation dur- ing intravenous drug administration and tissue structure, as well as physicochemical aspects such as the shape, binding strength, com- position, and modi\ufb01cation of carrier [14]. Moreover, factors like the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect in medical environments, extravasation, distribution within tumors, tumor variability, and the presence of overexpressed markers play pivotal roles in ensuring the effectiveness of treatments targeting tumors [15]. If the desired characteristics are adequately achieved and addi- tionally the formulation aspects are carefully addressed, TDD holds signi\ufb01cant promise in advancing nanomedicine and therapeutic interventions. While TDD offers potential bene\ufb01ts for managing various chronic as well as infectious illnesses, its most critical appli- cation lies in combating cancerous tumors. Th", " holds signi\ufb01cant promise in advancing nanomedicine and therapeutic interventions. While TDD offers potential bene\ufb01ts for managing various chronic as well as infectious illnesses, its most critical appli- cation lies in combating cancerous tumors. This is primarily because of its improved ability to penetrate tumor microenvironments and", "achieve higher drug concentrations at speci\ufb01c site of malignancy [16]. 56 Meemansha Sharma et al. The potential applications and objectives of TDD encompass a wide range of \ufb01elds including cancer treatment, vaccine enhance- ment, delivery to the ocular segment, brain regions, transportation of DNA and oligonucleotides, TDD within cells and throughout the body, oral and topical administration routes, utilization in enzyme immunoassays, in addition to radioimaging [17\u201319]. Nota- bly, the reported outcomes associated with these applications often involve decreased toxicity, enhanced cellular uptake, prolonged circulation within systemic circulation leading to enhanced drug availability, augmented immune responses, enhanced drug absorp- tion and penetration, also drug retention time improved in the body [20]. 3 Strategies Related to Site Speci\ufb01c Delivery of Insoluble Pharmaceutical Compounds Oral medications can be swiftly cleared from the body due to factors including stomach hydrolysis, enzymatic breakdown in gas- tric and small intestinal \ufb02uids, degradation in gut wall, and liver metabolism before systemic circulation [21]. The goal of pharma- ceutical development is often to enhance the dispersion of a water- insoluble pharmaceutical molecule in the gastrointestinal tract in order to attain adequate bioavailability when taken by mouth [22]. The following section discusses the most common methods used to increase the solubility of medications with limited water solubility (Fig. 2). 3.1 Changes in pH and Salt Development The majority of medicines are slightly basic, and about 70% of pharmaceuticals are ionizable [23]. Ionizable pharmaceuticals have a pH-dependent solubility; weakly basic drugs are soluble at pH > pKa, while slightly acidic compounds easily dissolve at pH ", "ajority of medicines are slightly basic, and about 70% of pharmaceuticals are ionizable [23]. Ionizable pharmaceuticals have a pH-dependent solubility; weakly basic drugs are soluble at pH > pKa, while slightly acidic compounds easily dissolve at pH < pKa [24]. This pH-dependent solubility has been extensively utilized to manufacture limited water-soluble drugs [24]. Cipro- \ufb02oxacin is a traditional medication that has a weak basicity and is almost undissolved in \ufb02uids at neutral pH. Nevertheless, it shows that its solubility is pH-sensitive, becoming more soluble in acidic conditions [25]. Alternatively, making salts out of mildly acidic or basic medications offers an additional method for formulating drugs with pH-dependent solubility [26]. Pharmaceutically accepted opposing ions in these salts can create favorable pH levels upon dissolution in water, resulting in a solution with a pH close to the maximum solubility pH of the drugs [26]. Consequently, salt forms may eliminate the requirements for pH modi\ufb01cation which are essential for solubilizing the drugs. Furthermore, formation of salt has been observed to enhance crystalline structure, strength,", "and the pharmaceutical processability of drugs [27]. The market offers rosuvastatin (partially soluble) in the form of its calcium salt [25]. Pharmaceutical industries are always investigating medication salt formulations in an effort to improve clinical ef\ufb01cacy [28]. Occa- sionally, it appears that pharmaceutical \ufb01rms are using reformula- tion as a different way to take advantage of marketing access and captives. Targeted Drug Delivery: Principles and Strategies 57 Fig. 2 The forms of targeted drug delivery of poorly soluble compounds 3.2 Polymeric Micelles Amphiphilic block copolymers create microscopic shell structures known as polymeric micelles. Micelles polymers are very well suited for drug administration due to their inherent and adjustable char- acteristics [29]. Encapsulating water-insoluble drugs in micelles allows them to be formulated in aqueous vehicles due to their af\ufb01nity for hydrophobic solvents because of their inclination toward non-polar liquids and the hydrophobic regions of micelles, facili- tated by hydrophobic-hydrophobic interactions [22]. Diblock polymers like PEG-PLA (polyethylene glycol-poly lactic acid) or polymers of triblock PEG-(PLA-PLA) are utilized to generate polymeric micelles [30]. In a polymer for micelles (Fig. 3), the PEG is typically the polar component, while the tail of hydrophobic component can consist of polylactic acid, polyaspartic acid, poly- caprolactic acid [25]. Moreover, polymeric micelles can be engi- neered for active targeting with the use of site-speci\ufb01c compounds and pH-responsive release of drug at particular tissues. Paclitaxel is contained in micelles of polymeric nature called Genexol-PM, which are made of PEG polymer [31]. This has been the initial", "H-responsive release of drug at particular tissues. Paclitaxel is contained in micelles of polymeric nature called Genexol-PM, which are made of PEG polymer [31]. This has been the initial", "version of \ufb01rst FDA-approved formulation of polymeric micelles, and it is said to be more secure and tolerable than other commercial formulations [31]. Additionally, micellar solubilization has been effective in the development and commercialization of numerous medications with low water solubility, including paclitaxel injec- tion, cyclosporine injection, and griseofulvin-PEG-dispersion [22]. 58 Meemansha Sharma et al. Fig. 3 Polymeric micelles (therapeutic agent\u2014pink color) 3.3 Nanonization The technique of using active medication as sub-micron-sized par- ticulates, or nanoparticles, is called nanonization [32]. Within the drug sectors, formulations of size lesser than 1 \u03bcm are de\ufb01ned as nanoparticles [32]. Different methods, generally classi\ufb01ed as \u201cbot- tom up\u201d and \u201ctop down\u201d technologies, may be utilized to produce drug nanoparticles [33]. Reducing the dimension of the medica- tion to the nanometer scale enhanced its surface area, which can potentially boost its diffusion rate [34]. This is the basic basis of the process of nanonization for hydrophobic medications. The large surface area of nanoparticles facilitates their easy solubility in liquids, which enhances dissolution of the included medications [34]. The process of the micronization has been extensively researched, but size reduction to the nanoscale can speed up the material\u2019s solubility and enhance its rate of dissolution. Nanostruc- tured medicines can achieve distinctive surface properties through processes like functionalization and coating with speci\ufb01c molecules. These molecules include elongated hydrophilic co-polymers like polyethylene glycols and polyethyleneimine, along with molecules that bind to receptors like folic acid, carbohydrates, oestradiol, and monoclonal antibodies. These modi\ufb01cations e", "ecules. These molecules include elongated hydrophilic co-polymers like polyethylene glycols and polyethyleneimine, along with molecules that bind to receptors like folic acid, carbohydrates, oestradiol, and monoclonal antibodies. These modi\ufb01cations enhance the medicine-targeting abilities, improve its stability, and optimize its interaction with biological systems, thus advancing its therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy [35]. These changes enhance the precision of pharmaceuti- cal delivery by enabling selective targeting to cells that have over- expressed receptors.", "Targeted Drug Delivery: Principles and Strategies 59 3.4 Liposomes Liposomes are tiny spheres composed of multiple overlapping bilayers of lipid consisting of phospholipids and cholesterol and are partitioned by aqueous compartments (Fig. 4) [36]. They were \ufb01rst used as transporter for drug transportation in the 1970 [37]. These liposomes are extensively utilized for delivering both polar and non-polar drugs, which are situated within their respec- tive compartments of aqueous and lipid bilayers [38]. Liposomes are classi\ufb01ed into three distinct categories based on their dimension and surrounded numbers of layers: size >500 nm, multilamellar vesicles; size >100 nm, bigger unilamellar vesicles; and a mean diameter of 20\u2013100 nm, smaller unilamellar vesicles [32]. Encapsu- lating drugs in liposomes shields the active substances from enzy- matic breakdown and can mitigate their toxicity [39]. Additionally, liposomes are pliable, compatible with biological milieus, degrad- able on their own, and unlikely to trigger immune responses. They can ef\ufb01ciently transport signi\ufb01cant quantities of drugs which are lipophilic in nature and can be altered to regulate their physical and chemical properties, thereby in\ufb02uencing their interactions within the body [39]. Liposomes are currently being employed as excipi- ents for developing commercial preparation of a number of lipo- philic, low water-soluble drugs, like amphotericin B, that are more effectively absorbed [40]. 3.5 Solid Lipid Nanoparticles Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) \ufb01rst came up in the year 1990 as a way to transport non-water-soluble pharmaceuticals at room tem- perature inside a solid lipid matrix [41]. Solid lipids such as partial glycerides, triglycerides, steroids, fatty acids, or waxes make up the composition of the n", " in the year 1990 as a way to transport non-water-soluble pharmaceuticals at room tem- perature inside a solid lipid matrix [41]. Solid lipids such as partial glycerides, triglycerides, steroids, fatty acids, or waxes make up the composition of the nanoparticles (Fig. 5) [42]. These fatty acids are anchored with compatible emulsi\ufb01ers such as phospholipids, bile salts, polysorbates, polyoxyethylene ethers, or polyvinyl alcohols [42]. SLN technology could be explored to enable site-speci\ufb01c delivery of medicines, especially for peptides and merely soluble protein molecules [43]. SLNs are thought to possess signi\ufb01cant Fig. 4 Structure of liposomes (drug molecule\u2014green color)", "biocompatibility because of use of well-tolerated emulsi\ufb01ers. Simi- lar to other nanosystems, they have possessed capacity to shield pharmaceuticals and prevent from degradation by various enzyme or chemicals [44]. Additionally, these lipid tiny carriers can facilitate regulated delivery of medications and may be readily manufactured on an enormous scale without utilizing organic solutions. Pandita and coworkers [45] have made a SLN preparation for paclitaxel where they have shown an increased bioavailability of orally given paclitaxel in comparison with the control group in their in vivo experiment. Additionally, the other research showed that effective inclusion of weakly soluble medications such as feno\ufb01brate, camp- tothecin, and vinpocetine into SLNs enhanced their dissolving rate and bioavailability [25]. 60 Meemansha Sharma et al. Fig. 5 Structure of solid lipid nanoparticles 3.6 Co-crystal Preparation The issue of poor solubility of pharmaceutical in water may also be resolved by utilization of co-crystal methodology. Co-crystals are novel crystals that are created when more than two distinct com- pounds are arranged [46]. They have better qualities than each of the independent molecules. Co-crystal synthesis can occur via sub- limation, or ball mill grinding of more than two solid co-crystal formers [31]. The co-crystals\u2019 tendency to dissolve drugs are mainly due to their decreased lattice force and increased solvent adhesion properties [47]. Over the past ten years, pharmaceutical co-crystal nano-methodology has proven highly effective in admin- istering medications that were previously insoluble, thus making a substantial impact. Co-crystal methodology has been employed to increase the soluble nature of numerous drugs, including itracona- zole, carbamazepine, ", "ven highly effective in admin- istering medications that were previously insoluble, thus making a substantial impact. Co-crystal methodology has been employed to increase the soluble nature of numerous drugs, including itracona- zole, carbamazepine, gabapentin, caffeine, moda\ufb01nil, piroxicam, and various others [31]. 3.7 Dendrimers Dendrimers are three-dimensional, nanoscale biomolecules with a clearly de\ufb01ned spherical structure (Fig. 6). Due to their multivalent and host-guest trapping characteristics, they are frequently", "employed in different applications, including drugs and genes tar- geting delivery [48]. Dendrimers are believed to be the newest tools for encapsulating and delivering of bioactive molecules at the nanoscale [48]. They have demonstrated enormous promise as a medication delivery vehicle due to their ability to pass across both transcellular and paracellular membranes [49]. Dendrimers are worked in two ways to distribute the drugs where they can be employed in the formulation & nanoconstruct [49]. Normally, noncovalent interactions are used to entrap the drugs, whereas in nanoconstruct preparation, dendrimers are covalently bound. Vari- ous dendrimers like PAMAM (polyamidoamine), polypropylene, polylysine, and triazene have been employed in TDDs applications. It was discovered that dendrimers were used as drug-transporting agents to treat various illnesses including herpes simplex and HIV infection, anti-in\ufb02ammatory agents, antidotes, anti-Alzheimer\u2019s, anticoagulants, and tumor-killing agents [50]. Targeted Drug Delivery: Principles and Strategies 61 Fig. 6 Structure of dendrimers 4 Strategies Related to Tissue-Speci\ufb01c Targeted Drug Delivery Tissue-speci\ufb01c targeted drug delivery is a promising approach in medicine, aiming to enhance the ef\ufb01cacy of drugs while minimizing their side effects. Here are some strategies used in tissue-speci\ufb01c targeted drug delivery (Fig. 7). 4.1 Small-Sized Molecule-Based Targeting Strategies In targeted drug delivery, small sized molecules are are de\ufb01ned as substances with a molecular weight below 1kDa or a Stokes- Einstein radius of around 1 nm, enabling ef\ufb01cient transport and interaction at the cellular level [51]. Focusing on the chemical nature of small molecule based targeting structures, previous stud- ies have explored the potential of", " 1kDa or a Stokes- Einstein radius of around 1 nm, enabling ef\ufb01cient transport and interaction at the cellular level [51]. Focusing on the chemical nature of small molecule based targeting structures, previous stud- ies have explored the potential of small molecule targeting ligands for improved drug delivery. [52]. Small-sized molecule ligands often bind weakly to their targets; consequently, to achieve excel- lent target engagement, these ligands must act together with recep- tors that have deep topographies [53]. The most used small-sized molecule targeted agent is folic acid (FA). All cells utilize this vitamin to synthesize nucleotides. Different cells have receptors", "for folic acid, those can be addressed speci\ufb01cally. After FR-mediated endocytosis, FA facilitates effective intracellular distribution as well, assuming the linker has endosomal escape potential [54]. Another ef\ufb01cient family of small-sized molecule-based targeting ligands is monosaccharides, which include galactose, mannose, glucose, etc. For example, glucose targets the overexpressed GLUT1 receptor at blood\u2013brain barrier. Viable cells use glucose as a main energy fuel. A chemotherapeutic drug glufosfamide targets cells that undergo aerobic glycolysis by means of Warburg effect, altered by D-glucose [55]. Likewise, the mannose-6-phosphate receptor is a glycopro- tein present on transmembrane found in numerous organs, includ- ing the brain, lung, and cells of immune system. Receptors for proteins that respond to carbohydrates are called lectin-like recep- tors, and mannose-6-phosphate receptor represents one of them. Use of urea derivatives to target prostate-speci\ufb01c membrane anti- gen (PSMAg) has been examined [56]. Additionally, glutamate- urea has been included in single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging to diagnose PSMA markers [57]. Other small-sized molecules also found functional to target certain tissues likewise hyaluronic acid\u2019s af\ufb01nity for CD44 receptors [58], the competence of bisphosphonates as targets for bone [59], and chances of biotin-associated preparation delivery for applica- tion involving the biotin receptor that target tumors [60]. It\u2019s possible to target \ufb01rm tumors that express carbonic anhydrase using derivatives of sulfonamide [61]. Phenyl boronic acid selec- tively targets sialic acid components, whereas benzamides, such as anisamide, can target sigma-1 receptors [7]. For destabilization of proteins, a potent technique, proteo", "ic anhydrase using derivatives of sulfonamide [61]. Phenyl boronic acid selec- tively targets sialic acid components, whereas benzamides, such as anisamide, can target sigma-1 receptors [7]. For destabilization of proteins, a potent technique, proteolysis, targeting chimera is used. For example, thalidomides, a peptide-based PROTAC, have been recently utilized to exhibit knockdown effectiveness in non-human primate replica [62]. Givlaari is the only small-sized molecule-based targeting strategy product to receive FDA clearance [63]. 62 Meemansha Sharma et al. Fig. 7 Various strategies for targeting tissue-speci\ufb01c drug delivery", "Targeted Drug Delivery: Principles and Strategies 63 4.2 Nucleic Acid Fragment-Based Targeting Strategies Another targeting mechanism involves aptamers, which are mole- cules ranging in size from 5\u201315 kDa are known for their high speci\ufb01city in binding to target molecules. Aptamers are oligonu- cleotides consisting only one strand that can identify certain bind- ing regions on receptors. Dissimilar to small sized molecules, which often need profound topography to enable interactions, aptamers have a good binding capacity for the targeting interest and, because to their distinctive three-dimensional geometries, can act together with several \ufb02atter receptor surfaces [64]. Preclinical experiments are being conducted on most aptamers to arrange to assess their potential to target delivery of drug [65]. Many chemotherapeutic medications and nanocarriers can be conjoined to aptamers, which are generally \ufb02exible, multifaceted, three-dimensional con\ufb01gura- tion that help in ef\ufb01cient delivery of these substances deeply into the targeted cells and tissues [66]. Their tissue-speci\ufb01c drug libera- tion is major possibility because of these features and their minimal immunogenicity. Aptamers, in instance, bind more favorably with highly glycosylated receptors like MUC1. One aptamer beside VEGF that the FDA licensed for application in age-linked macular degeneration is among the numerous aptamers that have indepen- dently progressed to the clinic [67]. 4.3 Peptide- and Antibody-Based Targeting Strategies In various drug delivery stages, biomacromolecules, mainly anti- bodies (Abs), are frequently utilized. In the sub-nanomolar range, recombinant monoclonal Abs exhibit signi\ufb01cant binding coef\ufb01cient kD and high speci\ufb01city when interacting with their harmonizing antigens (Ags). Therefore, ", "acromolecules, mainly anti- bodies (Abs), are frequently utilized. In the sub-nanomolar range, recombinant monoclonal Abs exhibit signi\ufb01cant binding coef\ufb01cient kD and high speci\ufb01city when interacting with their harmonizing antigens (Ags). Therefore, monoclonal Abs have been employed to create immunoconjugates known as Abs drug conjugate (ADC) [68]. The majority of IgG antibodies have lengthy circulation periods, lasting from several days to many weeks. Their reproces- sing by cells of endothelial origin, which is facilitated by receptors present on surfaces, gives them very long half-lives, and they also enable substantial tissue exposure for related therapies. Neverthe- less, antibodies\u2019 distinct mechanism is only seen in their natural state. For example, Abs-modi\ufb01ed nanoparticles, for instance, get eliminated far more rapidly than free Abs [69]. FDA approved ADC including gemtuzumab ozogamicin, brentuximab vedotin, ado-trastazumab emtansine, etc., for solid and hematological tumors [70]. ADC are also being extensively researched as antiviral and antibiotic in both preclinical and experimental situations [71]. Strategies to target tissue involved peptides and Abs: (A) Abs-mediated targeting techniques\u2014it rely on selecting appro- priate antibody-antigen pairs that ensure precise interaction with target site antigens while minimizing or avoiding effects on normal, healthy tissues; (B) peptide-mediated targeting techniques\u2014bio- mimetic peptides can be facilitated using bioinformatics and/or biomolecular methods like phage display. Therefore, peptides lead", "lay. Therefore, peptides lead", "to supramolecular self-assembly; nanocarriers, and peptide-drug conjugate [71]. 64 Meemansha Sharma et al. 4.4 Cell-Based Targeting Strategies Even though this technology is quite recent, cell-based targeting has bene\ufb01ts over conventional tactics, such as excellent speci\ufb01city and/or adaptability. Depending on characteristics and intended uses, drugs can sum up within cells or linked to surfaces of cell. Numerous cell types are involved in transportation of small or large molecules and even nanoparticles to particular tissues, including RBCs, stem cells, leukocytes, T cells, platelets, dendritic cells, and bacteria [71]. Disguised immune recognition and inherent tissue tropism are the two biological cornerstones upon which cell-based targeting techniques primarily rely [72]. When it comes to tissue- speci\ufb01c targeting, RBCs have been reviewed the most. In humans, RBC has several self-markers, including CD47, on surfaces that keep them from being removed by macrophages, which give them an extremely long circulation (120 days) period [73]. Owing to these bene\ufb01ts, RBCs are primarily utilized to target blood tissue, allowing for the prolonged release or retention of medications in the bloodstream [74]. Several medicines, from tiny to big particle, have been loaded onto or attached to RBC for treating a number of situations, including in\ufb02ammatory conditions, cancer, and disor- ders lacking in certain enzymes. For example, dexamethasone encapsulated in RBC produced a prolonged release of drug in people for as long as one month following dosage [75]. The leu- kocytes which have been most studied to target tissues includes monocytes or macrophages. Since monocytes/macrophages are capable to phagocytes, they preferentially absorb pathogens that are nano- or micro-sized, which pres", "wing dosage [75]. The leu- kocytes which have been most studied to target tissues includes monocytes or macrophages. Since monocytes/macrophages are capable to phagocytes, they preferentially absorb pathogens that are nano- or micro-sized, which presents prospect to use this char- acteristic to provide treatments as a nanoparticle. Macrophages may cross the blood\u2013brain barrier, and they are employed as a targeted method to deliver nanoparticles to the brain. Further, the capacity of monocytes and macrophages to target tumors for both remedial and analytical purposes had been examined by Christie & cow- orkers [76]. T cells and neutrophils are investigated as potential targets. Neutrophil-based approaches are operated to target lung in\ufb02ammations and neuroin\ufb02ammation beside tumor microenviron- ments [77]. Targeting techniques based on monocyte/macro- phages and neutrophils are still limited to preclinical investigations and not yet used in clinical applications [78]. Clin- icians have evaluated >200 T cell-based treatments for malignan- cies and viral infections [79]. Based on innate or obtained tropism of stem cells to certain diseased/pathological areas, stem cells also have been further studied as targeted speci\ufb01c delivery techniques [80]. Stem cells can migrate to wounds, in\ufb02ammation, and tumors because they possess chemokine receptors. So, stem cells, particu- larly mesenchymal stem cells, are being used to nearly every organ as a targeted technique for tumors or injuries [81]. The most well-", "known function of platelets is blood clotting and thrombosis. The investigation of utilizing platelets as an avenue to target vessels damage and thrombosis areas was prompted by the platelets biological function [1]. Additionally, platelets have a natural af\ufb01nity for surgical wounds, and research has recently focused on using them to target and treat residual malignancies after surgery [82]. Targeted Drug Delivery: Principles and Strategies 65 5 Conclusion Targeted-delivery nanomedicines could be made with a wide range of nanoparticles. TDDs is an emerging \ufb01eld in medicine for the identi\ufb01cation and management of fatal illnesses. Conjugated poly- meric micelles, nanoparticles, dendrimers, and liposomes exhibit distinct structural characteristics that enable effective drug binding, enhancing site-speci\ufb01c delivery. Further, evaluating current devel- opments in hydrophobic compounds and their transportation at speci\ufb01c target site can lead to more effective medicinal uses and increased compliance among patients. Devices used for delivering insoluble drug compounds are increasingly being utilized for com- mercial bene\ufb01ts, with a focus on developing improved formula- tions. Continued progress in these devices and their evaluation for novel drug applications hold signi\ufb01cant promise for the future development. Apart from above-mentioned points, we have included various strategies employing molecules or ligands that target particular cells or tissues involved in the pathogenesis of speci\ufb01c diseases. Various body cells possess distinct capabilities for tissue-speci\ufb01c targeting as a result of either their physiological functions or chemotaxis responding to signals. Moreover, targeting molecules were categorized on the basis of range of targeting interactions, which included interac", " capabilities for tissue-speci\ufb01c targeting as a result of either their physiological functions or chemotaxis responding to signals. Moreover, targeting molecules were categorized on the basis of range of targeting interactions, which included interactions at the cellular level, with small molecules and antibodies. We underscored the distinctiveness of receptor-ligand biology and efforts in translating ligand-targeted systems into clinical applications. References 1.

Key words Nanotechnology, Drug delivery, Nanoparticles, Targeted delivery, Controlled release 1 Introduction In recent decades, the \ufb01eld of nanotechnology has emerged as a powerful tool in revolutionizing various aspects of medicine, par- ticularly drug delivery. The ability to manipulate matter at the nanoscale has opened up new avenues for the development of novel therapeutics, enhancing their ef\ufb01cacy, speci\ufb01city, and safety pro\ufb01les [1]. This integration of nanotechnology with pharmaceuti- cal sciences has led to the birth of nanomedicine, a rapidly evolving interdisciplinary \ufb01eld with profound implications for healthcare. The primary objective of drug delivery systems is to transport therapeutic agents to their target sites within the body in a con- trolled manner, maximizing therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy while minimizing side effects [2]. Traditional drug delivery approaches often face challenges such as poor bioavailability, off-target effects, rapid clearance, and systemic toxicity. Nanotechnology offers promising solutions to overcome these limitations by providin", "side effects [2]. Traditional drug delivery approaches often face challenges such as poor bioavailability, off-target effects, rapid clearance, and systemic toxicity. Nanotechnology offers promising solutions to overcome these limitations by providing platforms for precise control over drug release kinetics, improved targeting cap- abilities, and enhanced biocompatibility [3]. At the heart of nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems lie nanoparticles, which are typically in the size range of 1 to 1000 Abhishek Pathak and Satya Pal Singh (eds.), Next-Generation Drug Delivery Systems, Methods in Pharmacology and Toxicology, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-4554-3_4, \u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025 71", "nanometers. These nanoparticles can be engineered from a variety of materials including polymers, lipids, metals, and inorganic sub- stances, each offering unique properties and functionalities [4]. By tailoring the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, researchers can \ufb01ne-tune their behavior in biological systems, enabling customized drug delivery strategies for speci\ufb01c therapeu- tic applications. One of the key advantages of nanoscale drug delivery systems is their ability to exploit the unique biological properties of tissues and cells [5]. For instance, nanoparticles can passively accumulate in tumor tissues through the enhanced per- meability and retention (EPR) effect, a phenomenon characterized by leaky vasculature and impaired lymphatic drainage in solid tumors. This passive targeting mechanism allows for preferential accumulation of drugs in tumor sites, thereby improving therapeu- tic outcomes while minimizing systemic exposure and associated toxicities [6]. 72 Mounil Mankad et al. Furthermore, nanotechnology enables active targeting strate- gies where nanoparticles are functionalized with ligands that can selectively bind to receptors overexpressed on the surface of dis- eased cells. This molecular targeting approach enhances the speci- \ufb01city of drug delivery, enabling precise localization of therapeutics to their intended targets. Such targeted delivery systems hold immense promise for the treatment of various diseases, including cancer, in\ufb02ammatory disorders, infectious diseases, and neurologi- cal disorders. In addition to targeted delivery, nanotechnology offers opportunities for controlled drug release, allowing for spa- tiotemporal modulation of drug concentrations at the site of action.

In addition to targeted delivery, nanotechnology offers opportunities for controlled drug release, allowing for spa- tiotemporal modulation of drug concentrations at the site of action. By encapsulating drugs within nanoparticles or conjugating them to nanoparticle surfaces, researchers can design formulations with tunable release kinetics, enabling sustained drug release over extended periods [7]. This controlled release capability not only improves therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy but also reduces the frequency of dosing, enhancing patient compliance and convenience. Despite the tremendous potential of nanotechnology in drug delivery, sev- eral challenges remain to be addressed. These include concerns related to nanoparticle stability, scalability of manufacturing pro- cesses, regulatory considerations, and long-term safety pro\ufb01les. Overcoming these hurdles requires concerted efforts from multi- disciplinary teams comprising chemists, biologists, engineers, clin- icians, and regulatory experts [8, 9]. 2 History The history of nanotechnology in drug delivery traces back to the mid-nineteenth century when Petros and his colleagues reported a study on the subject. However, signi\ufb01cant advancements began to emerge in the latter half of the twentieth century. In 1955, a pivotal", "development occurred with the conjugation of polymers and drugs, marking an important milestone. This breakthrough was followed by the appearance of the \ufb01rst controlled-release polymer device in 1964, providing a means for sustained drug delivery [10]. In 1965, the discovery of liposomes by Bangham laid the groundwork for liposome-based drug delivery systems. Subsequent years saw fur- ther advancements, including the report of albumin-based nano- particles in 1972 and the formulation of liposome-based drugs in 1973. The momentum continued in the 1980s, with the formula- tion and approval of the \ufb01rst micelle in 1983, showcasing the potential of nanotechnology. In 1989, the FDA granted approval for the \ufb01rst controlled formulation, signaling growing recognition in pharmaceutical sciences. The 1990s witnessed a watershed moment with the entry of the \ufb01rst polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugated with protein into the market in 1990, offering improved stability and prolonged circulation times. These advance- ments underscore the evolution of nanomedicine, re\ufb02ecting its transformative impact on healthcare delivery [11]. The evolution of nanoparticles from 1991 to 2022 is described in detail in Table 1. Recent advances are shown in Fig. 1.

Inorganic nanoparticles can be synthesized through various techniques including chemical pre- cipitation, thermal decomposition, and sol-gel methods. Examples of inorganic nanoparticles include gold nanoparticles, silver nano- particles, iron oxide nanoparticles, quantum dots, and titanium dioxide nanoparticles [33]. Gold nanoparticles, for instance, are prized for their optical properties and surface plasmon resonance, making them valuable in biomedical imaging, sensing, and cancer therapy. Iron oxide nanoparticles are widely used as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and as therapeutic agents for magnetic hyperthermia-based cancer treatment.

Carbon-based nanoparticles hold immense potential in advancing technologies related to electronics, energy, and mate- rials science [37]. Nanotechnology in Drug Delivery: From Bench to Bedside 79 4 Nanotechnology-Based Drug Delivery Systems Nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems represent a cutting- edge approach to enhancing the ef\ufb01cacy, speci\ufb01city, and safety of therapeutic agents. These systems leverage the unique properties of nanoparticles to overcome limitations associated with conventional drug delivery methods [38]. Below, there are four key types of nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems. 4.1 Smart Drug Delivery Systems Smart drug delivery systems are designed to respond to speci\ufb01c stimuli in the body, such as pH, temperature, enzymes, or external triggers like light or magnetic \ufb01elds [39]. By incorporating stimuli- responsive materials into nanoparticles, researchers can achieve controlled drug release at the target site, minimizing off-target effects and improving therapeutic outcomes. For example, pH-responsive nanoparticles can release drugs selectively in acidic environments, such as tumor tissues, exploiting the pH gradient between diseased and healthy t", "et site, minimizing off-target effects and improving therapeutic outcomes. For example, pH-responsive nanoparticles can release drugs selectively in acidic environments, such as tumor tissues, exploiting the pH gradient between diseased and healthy tissues [40]. Similarly, temperature- sensitive nanoparticles can release drugs in response to changes in temperature associated with in\ufb02ammation or infection sites. Smart drug delivery systems offer precise spatiotemporal control over drug release, optimizing therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy while minimizing side effects [41]. 4.2 Polymer\u2013Drug Conjugates Polymer\u2013drug conjugates involve covalent attachment of therapeu- tic agents to polymer chains, forming macromolecular prodrugs. This approach offers several advantages, including improved solu- bility, stability, and bioavailability of drugs, as well as controlled release pro\ufb01les. Polymer\u2013drug conjugates can be engineered to target speci\ufb01c tissues or cells by incorporating targeting ligands or responsive moieties into the polymer backbone [3, 42]. Addition- ally, these conjugates can bypass multidrug resistance mechanisms, enhancing the effectiveness of chemotherapy agents. Examples of polymer\u2013drug conjugates include polyethylene glycol (PEG)\u2013", "doxorubicin conjugates, which exhibit prolonged circulation times and reduced cardiotoxicity compared to free doxorubicin. Polymer\u2013drug conjugates represent a versatile platform for deliver- ing a wide range of therapeutic agents, including small molecules, peptides, and nucleic acids [43]. 80 Mounil Mankad et al. 4.3 Multifunctional Drug Carriers Multifunctional drug carriers integrate multiple functionalities into a single nanoparticle platform, enabling synergistic effects and enhanced therapeutic outcomes [44]. These carriers typically com- bine drug delivery capabilities with diagnostic, imaging, or target- ing functionalities to achieve personalized and precise treatments. For instance, nanoparticles can be engineered to simultaneously deliver chemotherapeutic drugs while imaging tumor tissues using contrast agents or targeting ligands. Additionally, multifunc- tional drug carriers can incorporate stimuli-responsive elements to enable triggered drug release in response to speci\ufb01c biological cues. By integrating multiple functionalities into a single platform, these carriers offer a comprehensive solution for diagnosing and treating diseases, particularly cancer [45, 46]. 4.4 Organic/ Inorganic Composites Organic/inorganic composites combine organic polymers with inorganic nanoparticles to leverage the unique properties of both materials [47]. These composites exhibit synergistic effects, such as enhanced stability, biocompatibility, and functionality, making them ideal candidates for drug delivery applications. For example, silica-based nanoparticles can be coated with biocompatible poly- mers to improve their colloidal stability and biocompatibility while enabling controlled drug release [48]. Similarly, gold nanoparticles can be functionalized with polymers to e", "mple, silica-based nanoparticles can be coated with biocompatible poly- mers to improve their colloidal stability and biocompatibility while enabling controlled drug release [48]. Similarly, gold nanoparticles can be functionalized with polymers to enhance their targeting speci\ufb01city and payload capacity for cancer therapy. Organic/inor- ganic composites offer a versatile platform for designing custo- mized drug delivery systems with tailored properties and functionalities [49]. 5 Nanoparticulate Drug Delivery Systems Nanoparticulate drug delivery systems have revolutionized the \ufb01eld of pharmaceuticals by offering precise control over drug release kinetics, improved targeting capabilities, and enhanced therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy. Among the various nanoparticulate drug delivery systems, liposomes, microemulsions, and nanoparticles stand out as versatile platforms with diverse applications [50, 51]. 5.1 Liposomes Liposomes are spherical vesicles composed of lipid bilayers, which enclose an aqueous core. These versatile nanocarriers can encapsu- late hydrophilic drugs within their aqueous core and hydrophobic drugs within their lipid bilayers, making them ideal for delivering a", "wide range of therapeutics [52]. Liposomes can be engineered to vary in size, surface charge, lipid composition, and membrane permeability, enabling customization for speci\ufb01c applications. One of the key advantages of liposomes is their ability to improve the pharmacokinetics of drugs by enhancing their solubility, stabil- ity, and bioavailability [53]. Moreover, liposomes can be functio- nalized with targeting ligands or stimuli-responsive moieties to achieve site-speci\ufb01c drug delivery and controlled release. Clinically approved liposomal formulations, such as Doxil\u00ae and AmBi- some\u00ae, have demonstrated signi\ufb01cant bene\ufb01ts in cancer therapy and antifungal treatment, respectively. Overall, liposomes represent a versatile and clinically validated drug delivery platform with immense potential for improving therapeutic outcomes [54]. Nanotechnology in Drug Delivery: From Bench to Bedside 81 5.2 Microemulsions Microemulsions are thermodynamically stable colloidal dispersions of oil, water, surfactants, and cosurfactants, typically ranging in size from 10 to 100 nm. These nanostructured systems offer advantages such as high drug-loading capacity, ease of preparation, and enhanced bioavailability of poorly soluble drugs. Microemulsions can solubilize both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs, facilitating their absorption and transport across biological barriers [55, 56]. Moreover, microemulsions can be formulated as transpar- ent or translucent systems, enabling various routes of administra- tion including oral, topical, and parenteral. The small droplet size and large interfacial area of microemulsions facilitate rapid drug release and uptake, making them promising candidates for targeted drug delivery and sustained release applications.

The small droplet size and large interfacial area of microemulsions facilitate rapid drug release and uptake, making them promising candidates for targeted drug delivery and sustained release applications. Despite their potential, challenges such as stability, sterilization, and scale-up remain to be addressed for widespread clinical translation of microemulsion-based drug delivery systems [57]. 5.3 Nanoparticles Nanoparticles refer to solid colloidal particles with sizes typically ranging from 1 to 1000 nm, composed of various materials includ- ing polymers, lipids, metals, and inorganic substances [58]. These nanoparticles offer a versatile platform for delivering therapeutic agents with precise control over drug release kinetics and targeting speci\ufb01city. Polymeric nanoparticles, such as poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles, offer advantages such as biocompati- bility, tunable degradation rates, and sustained drug release pro\ufb01les [59]. Lipid nanoparticles, including solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), combine the advantages of liposomes with improved stability and scalability. Inorganic nanoparticles, such as gold nanoparticles and iron oxide nanoparticles, exhibit unique physical and chemical properties that can be exploited for imaging, diagnostics, and therapeutic applica- tions. Nanoparticles can be surface-functionalized with targeting ligands, antibodies, or peptides to achieve active targeting of dis- eased tissues or cells. Additionally, stimuli-responsive nanoparticles", "particles", "can enable triggered drug release in response to speci\ufb01c biological cues, enhancing therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy while minimizing off-target effects. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems have shown promise in a wide range of applications, including cancer therapy, infectious diseases, neurological disorders, and regenerative medicine [60]. 82 Mounil Mankad et al. 6 Applications The application of nanotechnology in drug delivery has trans- formed the landscape of pharmaceuticals by offering novel approaches to enhance the therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy, speci\ufb01city, and safety of drugs [4]. Nanotechnology-enabled drug delivery systems leverage the unique properties of nanoparticles to overcome chal- lenges associated with conventional drug delivery methods, such as poor solubility, low bioavailability, off-target effects, and systemic toxicity [61]. 6.1 Enhanced Drug Delivery Nanotechnology offers precise control over drug release kinetics, enabling sustained release, targeted delivery, and site-speci\ufb01c accu- mulation of therapeutic agents [62]. Nanoparticles can encapsulate drugs within their core, protecting them from degradation and facilitating their transport across biological barriers [61]. Moreover, nanoparticles can be surface-functionalized with targeting ligands, antibodies, or peptides to achieve active targeting of diseased tissues or cells, while minimizing off-target effects on healthy tissues. This enhanced drug delivery approach improves the therapeutic index of drugs, allowing for lower doses and reduced side effects [63]. 6.2 Overcoming Biological Barriers Nanoparticles possess unique physicochemical properties that enable them to overcome biological barriers such as the blood\u2013 brain barrier (BBB), gastrointestinal epithelium, and mucus layers. Nanoparticle-based drug d", "2 Overcoming Biological Barriers Nanoparticles possess unique physicochemical properties that enable them to overcome biological barriers such as the blood\u2013 brain barrier (BBB), gastrointestinal epithelium, and mucus layers. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems can bypass or penetrate these barriers, allowing for targeted delivery of therapeutics to speci\ufb01c organs or tissues [64, 65]. For example, polymeric nano- particles can be engineered to enhance oral drug absorption by improving mucosal penetration and cellular uptake in the gastroin- testinal tract. Similarly, lipid-based nanoparticles can facilitate drug transport across the BBB for the treatment of neurological disorders [66]. 6.3 Controlled Drug Release Nanotechnology enables precise control over drug release pro\ufb01les, allowing for tailored drug delivery kinetics and spatiotemporal modulation of drug concentrations. Stimuli-responsive nanoparti- cles can release drugs in response to speci\ufb01c environmental cues such as pH, temperature, enzymes, or light, enabling triggered drug release at the target site [67, 68]. For instance, pH-sensitive", "nanoparticles can release drugs selectively in acidic environments, such as tumor tissues, exploiting the pH gradient between diseased and healthy tissues. This controlled release capability enhances therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy while minimizing systemic exposure and asso- ciated toxicities [69, 70]. Nanotechnology in Drug Delivery: From Bench to Bedside 83 6.4 Combination Therapy Nanotechnology facilitates the codelivery of multiple therapeutic agents, enabling combination therapy approaches to treat complex diseases such as cancer, infectious diseases, and in\ufb02ammatory dis- orders [42]. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems can encap- sulate different drugs with varying physicochemical properties within a single carrier, allowing for synergistic effects and improved therapeutic outcomes. Moreover, nanoparticles can codeliver drugs with diagnostic agents or imaging contrast agents, enabling real- time monitoring of treatment response and disease progression [71]. 6.5 Personalized Medicine Nanotechnology offers opportunities for personalized medicine by tailoring drug delivery systems to individual patient characteristics and disease pro\ufb01les [72]. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery plat- forms can be customized in terms of size, shape, surface chemistry, and drug-loading capacity to meet speci\ufb01c therapeutic needs [73, 74]. Furthermore, advances in nanomedicine enable the devel- opment of companion diagnostics and theranostic platforms, allowing for targeted drug delivery guided by patient-speci\ufb01c bio- markers or imaging modalities. This personalized approach holds promise for optimizing treatment outcomes, minimizing adverse effects, and improving patient adherence [75]. 7 Limitations While nanotechnology holds immense promise for revolutionizing drug delivery and improving ther", "his personalized approach holds promise for optimizing treatment outcomes, minimizing adverse effects, and improving patient adherence [75]. 7 Limitations While nanotechnology holds immense promise for revolutionizing drug delivery and improving therapeutic outcomes, it is important to acknowledge and address the limitations and challenges asso- ciated with its application in this \ufb01eld [76]. Some of the key limita- tions of nanotechnology in drug delivery include the following. 7.1 Complexity and Cost The development and manufacturing of nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems can be complex and costly [77]. The synthe- sis, characterization, and scale-up of nanoparticles require specialized equipment, expertise, and resources, which may pose challenges for academic researchers and pharmaceutical companies. Additionally, the regulatory approval process for nanomedicines can be lengthy and expensive, further adding to the overall cost of development and commercialization [78, 79].", "84 Mounil Mankad et al. 7.2 Biocompatibility and Toxicity While nanoparticles offer unique properties and functionalities, concerns regarding their biocompatibility and potential toxicity remain a signi\ufb01cant challenge [80]. Certain nanoparticles may elicit immune responses, cause in\ufb02ammation, or induce cytotoxic effects, leading to adverse reactions in vivo. Moreover, the long-term effects of nanoparticle exposure on human health and the environ- ment are not fully understood, necessitating comprehensive safety assessments and risk evaluations [81]. 7.3 Stability and Shelf Life Nanoparticles are susceptible to aggregation, degradation, and instability under physiological conditions, which can compromise their ef\ufb01cacy and shelf life. Factors such as pH, temperature, humidity, and storage conditions can impact the stability of nano- particles and affect their performance over time [82]. Strategies to improve the stability and shelf life of nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems, such as surface modi\ufb01cations, encapsulation tech- niques, and lyophilization, are actively being pursued [1]. 7.4 Drug Loading and Release Achieving optimal drug-loading capacity and controlled release kinetics is essential for the ef\ufb01cacy of nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems. However, certain drugs may exhibit poor solubil- ity, low encapsulation ef\ufb01ciency, or premature release from nano- particles, limiting their therapeutic potential. Furthermore, achieving precise control over drug release pro\ufb01les, especially in response to speci\ufb01c stimuli or biological cues, remains a challenge that requires further research and optimization [83, 84]. 7.5 Biological Barriers and Clearance Nanoparticles face several biological barriers in vivo, including the reticuloendothelial system (RES), renal", "muli or biological cues, remains a challenge that requires further research and optimization [83, 84]. 7.5 Biological Barriers and Clearance Nanoparticles face several biological barriers in vivo, including the reticuloendothelial system (RES), renal clearance, and blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB), which can hinder their distribution and accumula- tion at the target site [85]. Strategies to evade or overcome these barriers, such as surface modi\ufb01cations, stealth coatings, and tar- geted delivery approaches, are essential for enhancing the ef\ufb01cacy of nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems. Additionally, the clearance of nanoparticles from the body via renal excretion or hepatic metabolism can limit their circulation time and therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy [86]. 8 Conclusions The integration of nanotechnology into drug delivery systems represents a signi\ufb01cant advancement with profound implications for healthcare. By leveraging the unique properties of nanoparti- cles, nanotechnology offers solutions to overcome the limitations of traditional drug delivery approaches, including poor bioavailabil- ity, off-target effects, and systemic toxicity. Through precise control over drug release kinetics and enhanced targeting capabilities,", "nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems hold promise for improving therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy while minimizing side effects. The evolution of nanomedicine from its inception to the present re\ufb02ects a trajectory of innovation driven by interdisciplinary collaboration and technological advancements. However, challenges such as complexity, biocompatibility, stability, and regulatory considera- tions underscore the need for continued research and development in this \ufb01eld. Despite these challenges, the application of nanotech- nology in drug delivery has already demonstrated transformative potential, offering novel approaches to enhance drug delivery, overcome biological barriers, and enable personalized medicine. As research progresses and technologies evolve, nanotechnology is poised to play an increasingly pivotal role in shaping the future of pharmaceuticals and healthcare delivery.

This chapter explores the formulation strategies and applications of LBDDS in drug delivery. The formulation of LBDDS involves the use of lipids such as triglycerides, phospholipids, and surfactants to create various formulations such as liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), and lipid-based micelles.

These systems utilize lipid-based carriers to encapsulate and deliver pharmaceutical compounds, providing numerous advan- tages such as improved drug solubility, enhanced bioavailability, and targeted delivery [4]. Lipid-based drug delivery systems include lipid solutions, lipid emulsions, lipid dispersions, self- emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS), and self-micro emul- sifying drug delivery systems (SMEDDS) as shown in Fig. 1.

Additionally, they provide targeted and sustained drug release, allowing for optimized dosing regimens and improved patient compliance. This chapter aims to provide an overview of lipid-based drug delivery systems, their formulation techniques, and their applica- tions in the \ufb01eld of drug delivery. We will explore the advantages and challenges associated with different lipid-based formulations and discuss recent advancements in this \ufb01eld. Understanding the formulation principles and applications of lipid-based drug delivery systems can contribute to the development of more effective and ef\ufb01cient drug delivery strategies, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes and the advancement of pharmaceutical research and development. 2 Guidelines for Design of Lipid-Based Formulations While lipid-based formulations will continue to be an important tool for formulating poorly soluble drugs, the design of these formulations can be challenging.", "ations will continue to be an important tool for formulating poorly soluble drugs, the design of these formulations can be challenging.", "Lipid-Based Drug Delivery Systems: Formulation and Applications 91 In his outstanding review, The recently mentioned seven guide- lines for designing lipid-based formulations, which are given below. 1. It is essential to maintain the solubility of the drug in the formulation, after dispersion, and after digestion. 2. The properties of the colloidal species formed after processing in the gastrointestinal medium are probably more important than the properties of the formulation itself in improving absorption. 3. Higher proportions of lipid (>60%) and lower proportions of surfactant (<30%) and cosolvent (<10%) generally lead to more robust drug solubilization after dilution. 4. Medium-chain triglycerides can provide greater solubility and stability of the drug in the formulation, but long-chain trigly- cerides facilitate more ef\ufb01cient formation of colloidal lipid species from bile salts and thus can provide greater bioavailability. 5. Type IIIB self-emulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS) formulations give lower droplet sizes after dispersion. Still, they are more dependent on the surfactant properties employed, and nondigestible surfactants generally give greater bioavailability. 6. The dispersion of type IV formulations (surfactant/cosolvent) is probably more effective if two surfactants are used instead of just one. 7. Type IV formulations can provide increased drug solubility but must be designed with care to ensure that the drug does not precipitate after dispersion. These guidelines are important to consider when designing lipid-based oral formulations for poorly soluble medications. As more experience is gained with the design and use of these formu- lations and the database of successful formulations grows, it is to be expected that the design of these formulatio", "ing lipid-based oral formulations for poorly soluble medications. As more experience is gained with the design and use of these formu- lations and the database of successful formulations grows, it is to be expected that the design of these formulations will be less empirical as shown in Table 1. 3 Formulation Strategies The development of lipid formulations, particularly SEEDS and SMEDDS, is typically rooted in empirical methods. The effective- ness of a lipid formulation hinges on both the lipid excipients\u2019 characteristics and the compound\u2019s physicochemical properties. An ideal lipid formulation should effectively dissolve the entire drug dosage within a single unit and sustain the drug\u2019s solubility without precipitation within the gastrointestinal tract [10]. How- ever, formulating optimization faces additional hurdles due to", "limitations in preclinical models and uncertainties regarding how these formulations translate to the complexities of lipid processing in humans (as shown in Fig. 1). 92 Pratibha Yadav Table 1 Formulation type Formulation type Excipients Characteristics Advantages Limitations Type I Oils without surfactants (e.g., tri-, di-, and monoglycerides) Non-dispersing, requires digestion GRAS, simple, good capsule compatibility Poor solvent capacity unless drug is highly lipophilic Type II Oils and water insoluble surfactants SEEDS formed without water-soluble components Unlikely to lose solvent capacity on dispersion Rather coarse o/w dispersion, digestion likely but not crucial Type III Oils, surfactants, and cosolvents SEDDS/SMEDDS formed with water soluble or dispersible components Clear or almost clear Possible loss of solvent capacity 3.1 Lipid Nanoparticles Lipid nanoparticles, a cutting-edge technology in drug delivery, offer immense potential in pharmaceuticals.

Thermal stability is critical in industries such as aerospace, automotive, electronics, and materials science, where components and materials must withstand high temperatures dur- ing operation or processing. Adding thermal stabilizers, optimizing formulations, and conducting thermal stress tests are strategies to enhance thermal stability in materials and products. By conducting stability studies, researchers and industries can ensure product reli- ability, safety, and performance under diverse environmental con- ditions, contributing to product quality assurance and regulatory compliance. 5 Applications of Lipid-Based Drug Delivery Systems 5.1 Cancer Therapy Cancer therapy has witnessed signi\ufb01cant advancements in recent years, with targeted drug delivery systems playing a crucial role in improving treatment outcomes and reducing side effects [80]. Among these systems, lipid-based drug delivery stands out for its versatility, biocompatibility, and ability to encapsulate a wide range of therapeutics. Let\u2019s delve into the applications of lipid- based drug delivery systems speci\ufb01cally in cancer therapy. 5.1.1 Targeted Drug Delivery Lipid-based carriers can encapsulate chemotherapeutic drugs, pep- tides, nuclei", "apsulate a wide range of therapeutics. Let\u2019s delve into the applications of lipid- based drug delivery systems speci\ufb01cally in cancer therapy. 5.1.1 Targeted Drug Delivery Lipid-based carriers can encapsulate chemotherapeutic drugs, pep- tides, nucleic acids, and imaging agents, allowing for targeted delivery to cancer cells. Surface modi\ufb01cations with targeting ligands such as antibodies, peptides, or aptamers enable speci\ufb01c recogni- tion and uptake by cancer cells, reducing damage to healthy tissues [81]. 5.1.2 Combination Therapy Combination therapy, also known as combination chemotherapy or polytherapy, is a treatment approach that involves using multiple drugs or treatment modalities to target cancer cells through differ- ent mechanisms [82]. This strategy aims to enhance treatment ef\ufb01cacy, overcome drug resistance, and reduce the likelihood of cancer cells developing resistance to individual drugs. Here\u2019s an overview of combination therapy for cancer and its signi\ufb01cance in clinical practice.", "Lipid-Based Drug Delivery Systems: Formulation and Applications 103 5.2 Central Nervous System Disorders Central nervous system (CNS) disorders encompass a wide range of conditions affecting the brain and spinal cord, including neurode- generative diseases, psychiatric disorders, and neurological injuries [83]. Understanding the complexities of CNS disorders involves exploring two crucial aspects: blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) penetra- tion and neuroprotective effects. Let\u2019s delve into these areas and their signi\ufb01cance in addressing CNS disorders. 5.2.1 Blood\u2013Brain Barrier Penetration The blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) serves as a protective barrier that regulates the passage of substances between the bloodstream and the brain. While it plays a vital role in maintaining CNS homeosta- sis, it also poses a challenge for drug delivery to treat CNS dis- orders. Overcoming BBB penetration barriers is essential for effective therapeutic intervention [84]. The BBB is composed of specialized endothelial cells, tight junctions, pericytes, and astro- cyte end-feet, which together restrict the entry of large molecules, pathogens, and toxins into the brain. Many drugs, including large molecules like proteins and peptides, have limited BBB permeabil- ity, hindering their ef\ufb01cacy in treating CNS disorders [85]. Nanoparticles are utilized as carriers to transport drugs across the BBB, exploiting mechanisms like receptor-mediated transcyto- sis or adsorptive-mediated transcytosis. Using focused ultrasound in combination with microbubbles can temporarily disrupt the BBB and facilitate drug delivery [86]. BBB penetration is crucial for delivering therapeutic agents, including neuroprotective com- pounds, neurotrophic factors, gene therapies, and small molecules, to target brain regions affected b", "rily disrupt the BBB and facilitate drug delivery [86]. BBB penetration is crucial for delivering therapeutic agents, including neuroprotective com- pounds, neurotrophic factors, gene therapies, and small molecules, to target brain regions affected by CNS disorders. 5.2.2 Neuroprotective Effects Neuroprotection refers to strategies aimed at preserving, enhanc- ing, or restoring neuronal function and structure, thereby slowing down or preventing the progression of CNS disorders [87]. Neu- roprotective effects play a signi\ufb01cant role in managing various con- ditions, including neurodegenerative diseases, stroke, traumatic brain injury, and neuroin\ufb02ammatory disorders. Addressing central nervous system (CNS) disorders requires a comprehensive understanding of BBB penetration challenges and the development of neuroprotective strategies. Overcoming bar- riers to BBB penetration enables effective drug delivery to target brain regions, while neuroprotective effects aim to preserve neuro- nal function and mitigate disease progression [88]. Continued research into innovative drug delivery systems, neuroprotective agents, and personalized treatment approaches holds promise for improving outcomes and quality of life for individuals affected by CNS disorders.", "104 Pratibha Yadav 5.3 Antiviral and Antimicrobial Applications Antiviral and antimicrobial therapies play crucial roles in combating infectious diseases and improving public health. Advancements in drug delivery systems have paved way for more effective and tar- geted treatments [89]. In this context, lipid nanoparticles and antibiotic delivery systems have emerged as promising approaches. Let\u2019s delve into their applications in antiviral and antimicrobial treatments. 5.3.1 Lipid Nanoparticles for Antiviral Drugs Lipid nanoparticles are nanoscale carriers composed of lipids or lipid-like materials that can encapsulate and deliver various thera- peutic agents, including antiviral drugs. Lipid nanoparticles provide a protective environment for antiviral drugs, improving their stabil- ity and bioavailability. This is particularly important for fragile or easily degraded drugs [90]. Surface modi\ufb01cations of lipid nanopar- ticles can facilitate targeted delivery to speci\ufb01c cells or tissues infected by viruses, minimizing off-target effects and enhancing therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy. Lipid nanoparticles can traverse cellular bar- riers and deliver antiviral drugs directly into infected cells, improv- ing intracellular drug concentrations and inhibiting viral replication [91]. Some lipid nanoparticles can be engineered to interfere with viral entry mechanisms, such as blocking viral attachment or fusion with host cells, thereby exerting antiviral effects beyond drug delivery. For example, lipid-based nanocarriers like liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) have been investigated for delivering antiviral drugs such as nucle- oside analogs, protease inhibitors, and RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics. 5.3.2 Antibiotic Delivery Systems Antibi", "nanoparticles (SLNs), and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) have been investigated for delivering antiviral drugs such as nucle- oside analogs, protease inhibitors, and RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics. 5.3.2 Antibiotic Delivery Systems Antibiotic delivery systems encompass various formulations designed to improve the ef\ufb01cacy, safety, and targeted delivery of antibiotics to combat bacterial infections. Here are key aspects of antibiotic delivery systems: Lipid nanoparticles and antibiotic delivery systems represent innovative approaches in antiviral and antimicrobial treatments, offering targeted drug delivery, enhanced drug stability, sustained release, and improved therapeutic outcomes [92]. Continued research and development in these areas hold promise for addres- sing challenges such as drug resistance, intracellular infections, and localized infections, contributing to the advancement of infectious disease management and public health initiatives [93]. 6 Future Perspectives and Challenges This section discusses the potential future directions of lipid-based drug delivery systems and the challenges that researchers may face.", "It explores the integration of emerging technologies, personalized medicine approaches, and the need for continuous innovation in LBDDS development.

Kasturi Devi Abstract Over the past two decades, signi\ufb01cant advancements have been made in the \ufb01eld of polymeric drug delivery systems. These systems are de\ufb01ned as formulations or devices that enable the introduction of therapeutic substances into the body. The development of biodegradable and bio-reducible polymers has been instru- mental in the creation of new drug delivery systems, offering promising future prospects for practical applications. Natural polymers (arginine, chitosan, etc.) have been extensively explored for polymeric drug delivery systems due to their biocompatibility and biodegradability. Synthetic polymers (poly(ethyleni- mines), biodegradable and bio-absorbable polymers, etc.) have also been studied for their potential in drug delivery. Efforts have been made to develop targeted polymeric drug delivery systems that can speci\ufb01cally deliver drugs to desired sites, reducing side effects and improving therapeutic outcomes. The rapid development of polymeric drug delivery systems based on natural and synthetic polymers is revolutionizing the pharmaceutical \ufb01eld. Signi\ufb01cant progress has been made in using biocompatible and bio-related copolymers and dendrimers for cancer treatment, particularly as delivery systems for potent anticancer drugs. Combining insights from synthetic and biological \ufb01elds is expected to lead to new paradigms in the design of polymeric drug and gene delivery systems, enhancing their ef\ufb01cacy and safety.

Key words Polymeric drug delivery systems, Reservoir-Based Systems, Stimuli-Responsive Systems, Polymeric hydrogels 1 Introduction Developing a new drug is a demanding and costly process. Further- more, recent drugs often fail clinical trials due to their ineffective performance and tendency to cause severe side effects by damaging normal tissues. Traditional medications are unstable, toxic, and offer short-lived therapeutic bene\ufb01ts, compounded by solubility issues. The therapeutic outcomes of drugs hinge on their biochem- ical properties and how they are released. Modern drug delivery systems (DDSs) play a crucial role in ensuring the controlled, targeted release of drugs to speci\ufb01c body areas, thus addressing these challenges. Unlike conventional methods, DDSs enable Abhishek Pathak and Satya Pal Singh (eds.), Next-Generation Drug Delivery Systems, Methods in Pharmacology and Toxicology, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-4554-3_6, \u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025 111", "precise control over the timing, location, and rate of drug release, ensuring drugs are delivered effectively to targeted organs. This innovation not only enhances treatment ef\ufb01cacy but also boosts patient con\ufb01dence [1\u20135]. 112 Afroz Jahan et al. DDS involves using carriers or transmitters to deliver therapeu- tic agents to speci\ufb01c tissues or organs. Polymer-based drug delivery systems have emerged as a pivotal area of research in biomedical \ufb01elds, offering enhanced drug ef\ufb01cacy while minimizing side effects. Liposomes, micelles, and PNPs (polymeric nanoparticles) are prominent drug carriers known for their ability to encapsulate various therapeutic agents or diagnostics [6, 7]. Polymers are optimal tools providing drug delivery mechan- isms through the unique features of pharmacokinetics, circulation time, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. These polymers are chosen based on their physical, chemical, and biological properties, ensuring effective therapeutic function with minimal adverse effects [8, 9]. Initially developed for biodegradable surgical sutures, syn- thetic biodegradable polymers such as polystyrene (PGA, PLGA, PLA) have evolved to offer controlled drug release and reduced toxicity [10]. PNPs, with their high biodegradability, ef\ufb01cient drug encapsulation, and controlled release capabilities, are preferred car- riers in DDSs [11, 12]. An ideal polymer should possess low density, low friction coef- \ufb01cient, good corrosion resistance, excellent moldability, the ability to achieve a \ufb01ne surface \ufb01nish, capability for precise dimensional manufacturing, and be cost-effective. It should ideally not have poor tensile strength, low mechanical properties, or poor tempera- ture resistance.

It should ideally not have poor tensile strength, low mechanical properties, or poor tempera- ture resistance. The transparency or ability to be produced in different colors is a neutral characteristic that can be advantageous depending on the speci\ufb01c application. 2 Classi\ufb01cation of Polymers Polymers are classi\ufb01ed into following categories as depicted in Scheme 1. 3 Design and Characterization of Polymeric Drug Delivery Systems In polymer-based drug delivery systems, polymers play a crucial role in achieving controlled (zero-order) or sustained (\ufb01rst-order) release of drugs, thereby maintaining therapeutic drug levels over time and reducing dosing frequency [13]. These systems are broadly categorized into matrix, reservoir, and conjugated systems. 1. Matrix-Based Systems: These are among the simplest to pro- duce and extensively studied in drug release systems. In a", "Polymer-Based Drug Delivery Systems: Design and Characterization 113 Scheme 1 Classi\ufb01cation of polymers based on origin of source, structure, and molecular forces matrix system, the drug can exist in a dissolved or dispersed (amorphous/crystalline) state depending on the solubility of the drug in the polymer and its concentration [14\u201316]. 2. Reservoir-Based Systems: In contrast to matrix-based systems, reservoir-based systems feature a solid drug core enclosed by a polymeric membrane. The release pro\ufb01le is governed by the rate of drug diffusion through the membrane. These systems typically provide almost constant zero-order release as their dimensions remain relatively stable over time. However, con- cerns such as membrane rupture leading to sudden release (dose dumping) and the dif\ufb01culty of retrieving the system post-use limit their practicality. 3. Conjugated Systems: Covalently linking drugs with polymers is another strategy to control drug release pro\ufb01les and extend drug residence time in the body. Conjugates like poly(ethylene glycol)-drug conjugates enhance circulation time, thereby reducing both dosage and frequency of administration [17, 18]. Similarly, sequestering drugs within self-assembling polymeric nanoparticles (e.g., cyclodextrins, block copolymers) lead to drug-loaded micelles and nanoparticles. These systems release drugs through mechanisms such as diffusion or degra- dation. Moreover, using speci\ufb01c linker chemistries (e.g., \u2018S-S\u2019 disul\ufb01de) for active agents conjugated to polymeric nanocar- riers enables prede\ufb01ned loading and release kinetics from nanoparticle-drug conjugates.", "ede\ufb01ned loading and release kinetics from nanoparticle-drug conjugates.", "114 Afroz Jahan et al. 4. Stimuli-Responsive Systems: Smart polymers are a class of mate- rials comprised of a large variety of linear and branched (co)- polymers or crosslinked polymer networks. A hallmark of responsive polymers is their ability to undergo a dramatic phys- ical or chemical change in response to an external stimulus. Smart polymers (e.g., poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNI- PAM), poly((2-diethylamino)ethylmethacrylate) (PDEA)) can create intelligent controlled release systems. These polymers respond to environmental stimuli (e.g., temperature, pH) to modulate drug release rates, offering precise control over ther- apeutic delivery [19, 20]. 4 Responsive Polymers There are various designs of polymeric drug delivery systems; how- ever, the majority of them are responsive polymers. Hydrogels, micelles, liposomes, polyplexes, or polymer-drug conjugates are the responsive polymers most commonly used as polymeric drug delivery systems. 4.1 Polymeric Hydrogels Hydrogels are three-dimensional networks of water-soluble poly- mers, capable of absorbing and retaining large amounts of water. They can be derived from natural or synthetic polymers and are utilized extensively in controlled drug delivery systems due to their biocompatibility and inertness to many drugs. Biodegradable hydrogels, in particular, are employed as carriers for drug delivery because they can release drugs gradually over time. The high porosity of hydrogels plays a critical role in controlling the release rate of drugs, which depends signi\ufb01cantly on the diffusion coef\ufb01cient of the drug molecules through the gel matrix. This porosity can be tailored by adjusting the degree of cross-linking within the hydrogel network. Greater cross-linking generally leads to reduced porosity and slower drug rele", " the diffusion coef\ufb01cient of the drug molecules through the gel matrix. This porosity can be tailored by adjusting the degree of cross-linking within the hydrogel network. Greater cross-linking generally leads to reduced porosity and slower drug release, while lower cross-linking enhances porosity and accelerates drug release [21]. Hydrogels exhibit rapid swelling in aqueous environments, which facilitates both the release of entrapped drug molecules and the degradation of the polymer matrix. This characteristic is advan- tageous in drug delivery applications as it supports controlled and sustained release of drugs over time. For further visualization and understanding, refer to Fig. 1, which illustrates drug delivery through hydrogels. There are various classi\ufb01cations of polymer-based hydrogels including based on origin, composition, ionic charge, pore size, physical appearance, con\ufb01guration, crosslinking, external stimuli response, and others. Few are discussed below.", "Polymer-Based Drug Delivery Systems: Design and Characterization 115 Fig. 1 Schematic representation of drug-loaded polymeric hydrogel Polymer-based hydrogels can be classi\ufb01ed as natural, synthetic, or a combination of both based on their origin. Natural polymer- based hydrogels are hydrogels composed of polymers derived from natural sources, such as plants, animals, or microorganisms. These polymers are biocompatible, biodegradable, and often exhibit inherent bioactivity, making them suitable for a wide range of biomedical applications [22]. Natural polymers include collagen, alginate, chitosan, hyaluronic acid, and gelatin. Natural polymer- based hydrogels offer advantages such as their similarity to the natural extracellular matrix, which supports cell growth and tissue regeneration. They can also provide a favorable microenvironment for encapsulated cells or therapeutic agents [23, 24]. Synthetic polymer-based hydrogels are hydrogels composed of polymers that are chemically synthesized in the laboratory. These polymers are typically derived from monomers through polymeri- zation reactions, allowing for precise control over their chemical structures, properties, and functionality. Synthetic polymer-based hydrogels offer several advantages, including tunable properties, reproducibility, and the ability to incorporate various functionalities for speci\ufb01c applications [25]. Some common synthetic polymers used in the production of hydrogels are poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) [26, 27], poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) [28, 29], poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) [30, 31], poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) [32, 33], poly(HEMA) (hydroxyethyl methacrylate) [34], and others [35, 36]. Hybrid polymer-based hydrogels, also known as semi-synthetic polymer-based hydrogels, are a type of hydrogel ", "poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) [30, 31], poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) [32, 33], poly(HEMA) (hydroxyethyl methacrylate) [34], and others [35, 36]. Hybrid polymer-based hydrogels, also known as semi-synthetic polymer-based hydrogels, are a type of hydrogel material that com- bines both natural and synthetic polymers to form a network struc- ture [37, 38]. These hydrogels are created by incorporating natural polymers or biomolecules into a synthetic polymer matrix or by chemically modifying natural polymers with synthetic components. Polymer-based hydrogels can also be classi\ufb01ed based on their composition, which includes homopolymer [39, 40], copolymer", "[41, 42], multipolymer [43, 44], and interpenetrating network (IPN) hydrogels [38, 45]. 116 Afroz Jahan et al. Homopolymer-based hydrogels are a type of hydrogel that is composed of a single type of polymer. In other words, the hydrogel network is formed by crosslinking repeating units of the same polymer [39]. These hydrogels are created by polymerizing a monomer that consists of identical repeating units, leading to a three-dimensional network structure [40]. Homopolymer-based hydrogels have the ability of certain polymers to absorb and retain large amounts of water while maintaining their structural integrity. Copolymer-based hydrogels are indeed composed of two or more different monomers that undergo polymerization to form a three-dimensional network [46, 47]. These hydrogels offer unique properties that can be tailored based on the combination of mono- mers used in their synthesis [48, 49]. One example of a copolymer- based hydrogel is poly(ethylene glycol)-diacrylate (PEGDA). PEGDA hydrogels are formed by copolymerizing PEGDA mono- mers with a crosslinking agent such as N,N\u2032- -methylenebisacrylamide (BIS). Multipolymer-based hydrogels are hydrogels composed of three or more different polymer chains. These hydrogels are designed to leverage the bene\ufb01cial properties of each individual polymer, resulting in a unique combination of properties that can be tailored for speci\ufb01c applications [50, 51]. There are two com- mon methods for preparing multipolymer hydrogels. The \ufb01rst method involves blending different types of pre-synthesized poly- mers. This blending process allows for the combination of different polymer chains to achieve the desired properties [50, 51]. The second method for preparing multipolymer hydrogels is through the copolymerization of two or more mono", "ynthesized poly- mers. This blending process allows for the combination of different polymer chains to achieve the desired properties [50, 51]. The second method for preparing multipolymer hydrogels is through the copolymerization of two or more monomers. For instance, a copolymer of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and poly (lactic acid) (PLA) can be synthesized. PEG, being a hydrophilic polymer, enhances the water uptake of the hydrogel, while PLA, a biodegradable polymer, controls the degradation rate of the hydro- gel. By incorporating multiple polymer chains, multipolymer hydrogels offer a broader range of properties compared to single polymer-based hydrogels. 4.1.1 Characterization of Polymeric Hydrogels Characterizing hydrogels involves assessing both their structural and functional properties. Various microscopy techniques and mechanical tests are employed to gather comprehensive data on the material\u2019s attributes. Structural Analysis (a) Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM): It is used to analyze pore formation, pore size, crosslinking status, and the impact of loaded compounds on the gel structure [52].", "Polymer-Based Drug Delivery Systems: Design and Characterization 117 (b) Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy (LSCM): It is used for evaluating pore dimensions and shape. It is capable of com- plementary characterizations such as assessing hydrogel load- ing/unloading of solutes, solute dispersion/mobility, and distribution of solid loading materials [53]. (c) Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM): It provides topological and roughness information, as well as functional data like the elastic modulus of the gel. It correlates gel modulus with cell differentiation and migration, polymer cross-linkage degree, and solute mobility. (d) Alternative Techniques: Bright Field Microscopy is less com- monly used due to hydrogels\u2019 optical clarity and three- dimensional nature. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is used to determine the number of lamellae in hydrogels. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) provides infor- mation on the gel\u2019s internal structure at a nanometer scale [54]. Functional Analysis (a) Absorption Capacity and Rate: It is used to measure how much and how quickly the hydrogel absorbs solutes. (b) Absorbency Under Load: It determines the hydrogel\u2019s ability to absorb \ufb02uids under mechanical pressure [55]. (c) Solute Retention and Release: It is dynamic probing of drug concentration in the medium over time. It can be performed by various methods like: \u2022 High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC): Common for peptides. \u2022 Electrochemical Probing: Used for gases like H2S. \u2022 Fluorescence/Colorimetric/Absorbance Tests: Used for various solutes [56]. 4.2 Polymeric Micelles Polymeric micelles are nano-sized structures with a core-shell archi- tecture formed through the self-assembly of amphiphilic block copolymers. These copolymers consist of both hydrophilic and hydrop", "d for various solutes [56]. 4.2 Polymeric Micelles Polymeric micelles are nano-sized structures with a core-shell archi- tecture formed through the self-assembly of amphiphilic block copolymers. These copolymers consist of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments, making them suitable for delivering drugs that have poor solubility in water. The core of polymeric micelles is composed of hydrophobic blocks such as poly(propylene glycol) or poly(caprolactone). These hydrophobic cores can encapsulate hydrophobic drugs, protecting them from degradation and enhancing their solubility in aqueous environments. Surrounding the core is a shell made up of hydrophilic polymer blocks like polyethylene glycol (PEG) (Fig. 2). This shell stabilizes the micelle structure and helps prevent recognition by the immune system, thereby prolonging circulation time in the bloodstream.", "118 Afroz Jahan et al. Fig. 2 Schematic representation of drug-loaded polymeric micelle. Polymeric micelles offer several advan- tages: (i) They improve the solubility and stability of hydrophobic drugs. (ii) They can be tailored to release drugs in a controlled manner. (iii) They enhance drug bioavailability and reduce side effects 4.2.1 Characterization of Polymeric Micelle To understand and predict the behavior of micelles in a biological environment, comprehensive characterization is crucial. The char- acterization process involves a variety of techniques to assess the chemical composition, self-association, physicochemical properties, and in vitro and in vivo behaviors of the block copolymers used to form micelles [57]. Critical Micelle Concentration Determination (CMC) The critical micelle concentration (CMC) is a key parameter in the characterization of polymer micelles (PMs). It indicates the con- centration at which amphiphilic molecules self-assemble into micelles in a solution. The CMC re\ufb02ects the balance between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments of the block copolymers and is in\ufb02uenced by the characteristics of the hydrophobic groups, the molecular weight of the hydrophilic part, and the distribution of the hydrophilic part within the amphiphilic polymer [58]. The various methods for determining CMC are: (a) Light Scattering: Measures changes in the scattering of light by micelles as they form, providing an indirect indication of CMC. (b) Surface Tension: Monitors the surface tension of the solution, which changes signi\ufb01cantly at the CMC due to micelle formation. (c) Electrical Conductivity: Observes changes in the electrical conductivity of the solution, which varies with the formation of micelles. (d) Photometric Methods: Use optical probes to measu", " changes signi\ufb01cantly at the CMC due to micelle formation. (c) Electrical Conductivity: Observes changes in the electrical conductivity of the solution, which varies with the formation of micelles. (d) Photometric Methods: Use optical probes to measure changes in absorbance or transmittance that occur at the CMC. (e) Fluorometric Methods: Employ \ufb02uorescent probes that respond to the formation of micelles, allowing for precise CMC determination through changes in \ufb02uorescence inten- sity or wavelength shift [59].", "Polymer-Based Drug Delivery Systems: Design and Characterization 119 (f) Dynamic light scattering (DLS) is another technique for the determination of CMC. The scattered light in the DLS method is based on the molecular weight of the particles in micellar solutions. Morphological Characterization Various microscopic techniques can be used for the morphological characterization of PMs. There are various microscopic imaging techniques for micelle characterization. AFM is a high-resolution microscopical technique that is useful for the analysis of the mor- phology and size of the micelles. It can also be used for the evalua- tion of redox or temperature-related morphological changes. Cryo- TEM is another powerful tool used to determine the morphology of micelles. Compared to normal TEM, cryo-TEM allows the evaluation of micelles in their solution state. As the liquid back- ground is important for micelles, cryo-TEM is preferred for micelle characterization [60]. SEM is also used for the analysis of morpho- logical characters [61]. Physicochemical Characterization Structural aspects of the synthesized copolymer can be analyzed by employing Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) [62, 63]. Small- angle neutron scattering (SANS) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) are two powerful tools used for the structural analysis of micelles. 4.3 Liposomes Liposomes are spherical vesicles composed of phospholipids and cholesterol, arranged in a bilayer structure. They are also amphi- philic in nature, with an aqueous core surrounded by a lipid bilayer. Liposomes have an internal aqueous core suitable for encapsulating hydrophilic drugs. This core provides protection to the encapsulated drug and facilitates its delivery to targe", "- philic in nature, with an aqueous core surrounded by a lipid bilayer. Liposomes have an internal aqueous core suitable for encapsulating hydrophilic drugs. This core provides protection to the encapsulated drug and facilitates its delivery to target tissues. The phospholipid bilayer of liposomes encapsulates hydrophobic drugs, shielding them from the external environment and allowing con- trolled release over time. Surface modi\ufb01cations of liposomes, such as attaching dextran or PEG to the phospholipid bilayer, can enhance their circulation time in the blood stream and can also enhance the stability and pharmacokinetics of liposomal formula- tions. This modi\ufb01cation helps evade detection by the immune system and prolongs the therapeutic effect of the encapsulated drugs (Fig. 3). Liposomal formulations can be classi\ufb01ed into two categories: (i) Rigid vesicles liposomes\u2014conventional liposomes and niosomes (ii) Elastic or ultra-deformable vesicles\u2014transferosomes and etho- somes [64]", "120 Afroz Jahan et al. Fig. 3 Schematic representation of different types of liposomes 4.3.1 Ethosome Ethosomes are novel lipid-based nano-carriers used in drug deliv- ery systems. They are similar to liposomes but are speci\ufb01cally designed to improve the delivery of active pharmaceutical ingredi- ents (APIs), especially those with poor skin penetration due to their higher lipid content and ethanol presence. The production of the ethosomal vesicles can be evaluated using photomicrographs, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs [65]. The formulation\u2019s zeta potential can be determined using a zeta meter [66]. The reduction in mean vesicle diameter can vary depending on the ethanol and phospholipid concentrations [67\u2013 69]. The transition temperature of the vesicular lipid systems can be measured using differential scanning calorimetry, a method that can be used to detect ethanol-skin phospholipid interaction, a property connected to the \ufb02uidizing impact of ethanol on the phospholipid bilayers [70]. The ultracentrifugation method can be used to determine the ethosomes\u2019 degree of entrapment. The high level of lamellarity and the presence of ethanol in the vesicles can be used to explain why ethosomes can effectively entrap hydrophilic and lipophilic medicines.", "Polymer-Based Drug Delivery Systems: Design and Characterization 121 4.3.2 Transferosome A transferosome is a type of vesicular delivery system used in transdermal drug delivery, which consists of phosphatidylcholine and an edge activator. It is a \ufb02exible, ultra-deformable liposome capable of passing through the tiny pores of the skin to deliver drugs directly into the bloodstream or target tissues. Visualization of transferosomes can be performed using trans- mission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron micros- copy (SEM) [71]. Particle size and size distribution can be determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and photon correla- tion spectroscopy (PCS) [71, 72]. The drug entrapment ef\ufb01ciency by transferosomes can be measured by the ultracentrifugation tech- nique. Vesicle stability can be determined by assessing the size and structure of the vesicles over time, and drug content can be quan- ti\ufb01ed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or spectrophotometric methods. In vitro drug release can be measured using a diffusion cell or a dialysis method [73, 74]. 4.3.3 Niosome Niosomes (non-ionic surfactant vesicles) are microscopic lamellar structures formed by hydrating a mixture of non-ionic surfactants from the alkyl or dialkyl polyglycerol ether class and cholesterol. These vesicles are created in aqueous media due to the amphiphilic nature of the surfactants, which arrange themselves into closed bilayer structures when subjected to energy sources such as heat or physical agitation. The bilayer structure consists of the hydro- phobic tails of the surfactants facing inward, away from the aqueous solvent, while the hydrophilic heads faces outward, remaining in contact with the solvent. The formation of the bilayer vesicle requires energy input, suc", "ure consists of the hydro- phobic tails of the surfactants facing inward, away from the aqueous solvent, while the hydrophilic heads faces outward, remaining in contact with the solvent. The formation of the bilayer vesicle requires energy input, such as heat or physical agitation. Niosomes can be characterized by various methods to deter- mine their size, shape, bilayer formation, number of lamellae, membrane rigidity, and entrapment ef\ufb01ciency. These parameters are crucial for understanding the properties and potential applica- tions of niosomes in drug delivery systems. 1. Size and Shape: Niosomal vesicles are typically assumes spheri- cal shape. The mean diameter of niosomes can be determined using several techniques like laser light scattering method, electron microscopy, molecular sieve chromatography, ultra- centrifugation, photon correlation microscopy, optical micros- copy, freeze fracture electron microscopy [75]. 2. Bilayer Formation: The assembly of non-ionic surfactants into a bilayer vesicle is identi\ufb01ed by observing an X-cross formation under light polarization microscopy [76]. 3. Number of Lamellae: The number of lamellae in niosomes can be determined using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spec- troscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering, electron microscopy [77].", "122 Afroz Jahan et al. 4. Membrane Rigidity: Membrane rigidity is assessed by measur- ing the mobility of a \ufb02uorescence probe as a function of temperature [78]. 5. Entrapment Ef\ufb01ciency: After preparing niosomal dispersion, unentrapped drug is separated, and the drug remained entrapped in niosomes is determined by complete vesicle dis- ruption using 50% n-propanol or 0.1% Triton X-100 and ana- lyzing the resultant solution by appropriate assay method for the drug [79]. 4.4 Polyplexes or Polymer-Drug Conjugates One of the most commonly studied areas of polymer therapeutics is polymer-drug conjugates in which the low MW therapeutic and polymeric carrier are most often an anticancer agent and HPMA copolymer, respectively. This area was born from a landmark study by Ringsdorf in 1975 [80] and then further pioneered in the 1980s by Duncan & Kopecek, who designed the \ufb01rst targeted synthetic polymer-anticancer conjugates to progress to clinical trials [81, 82]. This work was comprehensively reviewed recently [83, 84]. In contrast to free drugs, which usually distribute ran- domly throughout the body and thus exert deleterious side effects, attachment of the therapeutic to polymer carriers limits cellular uptake to endocytosis, extends circulation times to several hours, and facilitates passive targeting of tumors [85]. The different types of polymer drug conjugates, viz., dendrimers, polymer-protein conjugates, and polymeric nanoparticles, is discussed in detailed below. 4.4.1 Dendrimers The word \u201cdendrimer\u201d derives from a Greek phrase of \u201cdendron,\u201d which means tree or meros or branch [86]. As early as 1978, Buhleir and coworkers synthesized and reported the \ufb01rst \u201ccascade\u201d and \u201cnonskid-chain-like\u201d molecules with molecular cavity topolo- gies, which later were recognized as the ", "ase of \u201cdendron,\u201d which means tree or meros or branch [86]. As early as 1978, Buhleir and coworkers synthesized and reported the \ufb01rst \u201ccascade\u201d and \u201cnonskid-chain-like\u201d molecules with molecular cavity topolo- gies, which later were recognized as the early forms of dendritic polymers [87]. Dendrimers have emerged as an important group of nanostructured carriers for the development of nanomedicine to treat various diseases. Because of structural diversity and adaptabil- ity, dendrimers have been used to deliver drugs and genes in many different ways. Dendrimer-drug conjugates could reduce systemic effects and increase ef\ufb01cacy at the targeted site compared with free drugs [88, 89]. It is reported that the half-life of drugs can be increased by conjugating with dendrimers. PAMAM dendrimers are one of the most used dendrimers for drug delivery systems [90\u201392]. The dendrimer architecture has three main sites for drug entrapment by using various mechanisms: (i) void spaces (by molecular entrapment), (ii) branching points (by hydrogen bonding), and (iii) outside surface groups (by charge\u2013charge inter- actions) (Fig. 4).", "Polymer-Based Drug Delivery Systems: Design and Characterization 123 Fig. 4 Schematic representation of dendrimer loaded with drug Dendrimers can be characterized by various methods, viz., nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), gel permeation chromatogra- phy (GPC), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Recently, electrophoretic and mass spectroscopy measurements have been developed to detect the mono-dispersity features and the effective charge of dendrimers [93, 94]. 4.4.2 Polymer-Protein Conjugates The concept of PEGylation, which involves the covalent attach- ment of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to peptides and proteins, was pioneered by Davis and colleagues in the late 1970s [95]. This technique has since become the preferred method to enhance the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of protein ther- apeutics [96]. PEGylation helps in extending the circulation time of protein therapeutics in the bloodstream, thereby maintaining drug concentrations at therapeutically relevant levels [85]. PEG is non-immunogenic and non-antigenic, reducing the likelihood of immune responses against the therapeutic proteins. PEG is approved by the FDA for various pharmaceutical formulations, including injectable, topical, rectal, and nasal applications. The hydrophilic nature of PEG provides a protective shield around the protein, reducing recognition and clearance by the immune system [97]. PEG can be synthesized to facilitate speci\ufb01c conjugation sites without crosslinking the protein, allowing the therapeutic to be released effectively. While PEGylation can protect proteins from degradation and immune responses, it can also reduce or alter the biological activity of the protein. PEG is not biodegradable, which can limit its long-term us", "ng the therapeutic to be released effectively. While PEGylation can protect proteins from degradation and immune responses, it can also reduce or alter the biological activity of the protein. PEG is not biodegradable, which can limit its long-term use and lead to potential accumulation in the body. Although the increased circulation time of PEGylated pro- teins can compensate for reduced activity, this balance must be carefully managed to ensure therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy. Despite its limita- tions, PEGylation remains a critical technique in the development of polymer-protein conjugates [97]. Ongoing research aims to address these challenges by exploring alternatives to PEG that offer similar bene\ufb01ts with improved biodegradability and reduced impact on protein activity (Fig. 5).", "124 Afroz Jahan et al. Fig. 5 Schematic representation of polymer-protein conjugate 4.4.3 Polymeric Nanoparticles Certain chemical entities are either rapidly degraded and/or meta- bolized after administration (peptides, proteins, and nucleic acids). This is the reason the idea that nanotechnologies may be employed to modify or even to control the drug distribution at the tissue, cellular, or sub-cellular levels has emerged. Thus, nanotechnology may be employed to modify or even to control the drug distribu- tion at the tissue, cellular, or sub-cellular compartment. Among the technologies utilized for drug targeting are polymer-based nano- particles, which have been developed since the early 1980s, when progress in polymer chemistry allowed the design of biodegradable and biocompatible materials. Nanoparticles may be de\ufb01ned as being submicron (<1 \u03bcm) colloidal systems generally composed of polymers. Thus, nanoparticles are colloidal systems with a size 7 to 70 times smaller than the red cells. They may be administered intravenously without any risk of embolization. Based on the method of preparation, these can be nanocapsules or nanospheres. Nanospheres are matrix system in which the drug is dispersed within the polymer throughout the body of particle. Nanocapsules are vesicular systems in which cavity contains drug (oily/aqueous core) and is surrounded by a single ultrathin mem- brane of polymer (reservoir systems for controlled release of drug) as depicted in Fig. 6. Drugs are released from the nanosphere and nanocapsule by diffusion through the polymer or by degradation of the polymer. Nanospheres and nanocapsules can be injected or taken orally [21]. Polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit diverse physical proper- ties such as composition, concentration, size, shape, ", "y diffusion through the polymer or by degradation of the polymer. Nanospheres and nanocapsules can be injected or taken orally [21]. Polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit diverse physical proper- ties such as composition, concentration, size, shape, surface proper- ties, crystallinity, and dispersion state. Thorough characterization of these properties is crucial for understanding the applicability of NPs, assessing nanotoxicology, ensuring health and safety in work- places, and controlling manufacturing processes. Several techniques are employed for comprehensive characterization. The common characterization methods include: (a) Electron Microscopy: It includes scanning electron micros- copy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)", "Polymer-Based Drug Delivery Systems: Design and Characterization 125 Fig. 6 Schematic representation of polymeric nanoparticle for detailed morphology analysis. SEM provides high- resolution images of NP surfaces to study shape and size. TEM is capable of distinguishing between nanocapsules and nanospheres, and measuring nanocapsule wall thickness. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) provides three-dimensional, high-resolution images of surface morphology at a nanometric scale [98]. (b) Dynamic light scattering (DLS): Also known as photon corre- lation spectroscopy (PCS), it is used to determine size distri- bution and zeta potential. (c) Near-Infrared Spectroscopy: It is employed for assessing chemical composition. (d) Electrophoresis: It is used to measure surface charge and zeta potential. (e) Chromatography: It is used for analyzing composition and purity [99]. Chemically nanoparticle comprises of constituent elements along with native or formed functional groups. The measurement of the formed nanoparticle can be done using an ensemble or single-particle elemental analysis method. One of the most", "common ensemble techniques used is atomic absorption spectros- copy which is based on the principle of atomic absorption, where ground state electrons of the atoms jump to an excited state by absorbing a certain quantity of energy from light at a speci\ufb01c wavelength [100]. One of the techniques used to determine the chemical composition of a single particle is time-of-\ufb02ight mass spectrometry (TOFMS) that consists of ionizing small to large organic analytes into the gas phase with minimal fragmentation and their subsequent separation/detection using a time-of-\ufb02ight mass analyzer [101]. The arrangement of elemental atoms in a nanoparticle may be organized into a crystal structure or it may be amorphous. Generally, crystal structure is determined using powder X-ray diffraction or selected area electron diffraction using a transmission electron microscope [102\u2013104]. 126 Afroz Jahan et al. 5 Conclusion Research in polymer therapeutics has seen signi\ufb01cant progress over the past few decades, demonstrating success in the safe and effective delivery of bioactive agents for treating a wide range of medical conditions. The initiatives reviewed show substantial promise in enhancing drug delivery by ensuring drugs are distributed speci\ufb01- cally to needed locations in therapeutically relevant quantities, thereby reducing reliance on patient dosing efforts. Moving for- ward, research should focus on better understanding the interac- tion between polymers and biological systems. Many recent studies have introduced novel chemical approaches for advanced drug delivery systems, but biocompatibility studies are often delayed until late in development. This oversight can lead to failures at later development stages.

This oversight can lead to failures at later development stages. Early cellular and animal studies will help ensure that polymer-related innovations and in vitro successes translate into effective and safe drug delivery platforms. 6 Future Prospects 1. Future treatments will require delivery vehicles capable of highly regulated and site-speci\ufb01c payload delivery to achieve therapeutically relevant concentrations in subcellular organelles. 2. Upcoming therapeutic systems will recognize key bioanalytes indicative of speci\ufb01c diseases. Through unique triggering mechanisms, either physical or chemical, these systems will deliver therapeutic agents. The optimization of these systems will be signi\ufb01cantly in\ufb02uenced by classical chemical engineering principles, particularly control theory.", "Polymer-Based Drug Delivery Systems: Design and Characterization 127 3. The blood\u2013brain barrier, composed of tightly sealed endothe- lial cells, poses a signi\ufb01cant challenge for the effective delivery of therapeutics for neurological and psychiatric disorders. PEG-grafted polymer nanoparticles show promise in facilitat- ing transport into deep brain areas without damaging the blood\u2013brain barrier or other brain structures. 4. Targeted therapeutic delivery of high-potency drugs at rela- tively high payloads to speci\ufb01c sites, particularly tumor, is a major focus area. Advanced delivery systems will combine chemical and biological methods to achieve precise localization and therapy at targeted sites.

This work focuses on the smart materials and mecha- nism of action of several stimuli-responsive polymeric carriers, which are important in both the extracellular and intracellular domains of diseased tissues or cells. Research is being conducted globally to design new stimuli-responsive carriers, both internal and external, for biotechnological applications in general and biomedical and/or pharmaceutical applications in particular. This is because science has an ever-expanding body of knowledge and awareness. An essential component of designing so-called smart DDS, which sophisticatedly regulates dose loading, sustained release, individual variability, and targeted permeability, is the carriers\u2019 dual-/multi-responsive, internal, and even external behaviors. Various stimulus-responsive DDS have been developed, proposed, and utilized thus far. These include systems responsive to electrical, magnetic, pH, temperature, photo/light-induced reactions, and redox stimuli. Additionally, dual and multi-responsive DDS, which combine two or more of these stimuli, have been explored for enhanced therapeutic ef\ufb01ciency. In order to close the research gap, a number of dif\ufb01cult issues still need to be resolved despite the tremendous advancements made in the DDS \ufb01eld. To \ufb01ll in the gaps in the literature, an attempt has been made to draw attention to those important issues in this", "close the research gap, a number of dif\ufb01cult issues still need to be resolved despite the tremendous advancements made in the DDS \ufb01eld. To \ufb01ll in the gaps in the literature, an attempt has been made to draw attention to those important issues in this context. As a result, the focus was on the mechanisms of drug release and the clinical applications of exogenous and endogenous stimuli- responsive DDS. Key words Stimuli-responsive, Drug delivery, Polymeric carriers, Endogenous, Exogenous, Nanotechnology 1 Introduction The landscape of drug delivery systems has evolved signi\ufb01cantly over the past few decades. Traditional drug delivery methods, such as oral and intravenous administration, have been the backbone of therapeutic practices. While effective, these methods often present challenges, including suboptimal bioavailability, systemic side effects, and lack of targeted delivery [1]. These limitations have driven the quest for more advanced drug delivery systems, Abhishek Pathak and Satya Pal Singh (eds.), Next-Generation Drug Delivery Systems, Methods in Pharmacology and Toxicology, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-4554-3_7, \u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025 133", "culminating in the development of stimuli-responsive drug delivery systems (SRDDS). These systems are engineered to release thera- peutic agents in response to speci\ufb01c physiological or external sti- muli, offering a controlled, targeted, and ef\ufb01cient means of drug delivery [2]. 134 Manisha et al. 2 De\ufb01nition of Stimuli-Responsive Drug Delivery Systems Stimuli-responsive drug delivery systems are advanced drug deliv- ery platforms designed to release therapeutic agents in response to speci\ufb01c internal or external triggers [3]. These systems aim to enhance therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy, minimize side effects, and provide controlled and targeted delivery of drugs. The underlying concept is to ensure that the drugs are released precisely where and when they are needed, responding to speci\ufb01c physiological conditions or external signals. 2.1 Types of Stimuli Stimuli that trigger drug release in SRDDS can be broadly categor- ized into internal and external stimuli (Fig. 1). 1. Internal Stimuli (a) pH: Variations in pH levels within different body environ- ments (e.g., acidic pH in the stomach or tumor tissues) (b) Temperature: Localized hyperthermia in in\ufb02amed or cancerous tissues (c) Redox potential: Differences in oxidative and reductive conditions inside and outside cells (d) Enzymatic activity: Presence of speci\ufb01c enzymes at disease sites Fig. 1 Classi\ufb01cation of various types of stimuli", "Stimuli-Responsive Drug Delivery Systems: From Concept to Clinical Translation 135 2.

Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for designing effective stimuli-responsive systems. 3.1 pH-Responsive Systems Mechanism: These systems utilize materials that undergo changes in solubility, charge, or structure in response to pH variations (Fig. 2). For example, polymers containing acidic or basic groups can swell, dissolve, or degrade at speci\ufb01c pH levels, releasing the encapsulated drug. Example: Poly(methacrylic acid) nanoparticles that release drugs in acidic tumor microenvironments. Fig. 2 Mechanism of action of pH-responsive drug delivery system", "136 Manisha et al. Fig. 3 Mechanism of action of temperature-responsive drug delivery system 3.2 Temperature- Responsive Systems Mechanism: These systems are based on materials that exhibit phase transitions at certain temperatures (Fig. 3). Thermo-responsive polymers, such as poly(N-isopropylacrylamide), can change from a hydrophilic to a hydrophobic state at a critical tempera- ture, causing drug release. Example: Injectable hydrogels that solidify at body temperature, allowing localized drug delivery. 3.3 Light- Responsive Systems Mechanism: Light-responsive systems use photo-responsive mate- rials that undergo structural changes upon exposure to speci\ufb01c wavelengths of light. This can include photoisomerization, photodegradation, or photothermal effects. Example: Gold nanoparticles that convert light energy into heat, triggering drug release. 3.4 Redox- Responsive Systems Mechanism: Redox-responsive systems often utilize disul\ufb01de lin- kages or other redox-responsive bonds that are stable under extracellular oxidative conditions but cleaved in the reductive intracellular environment, leading to drug release (Fig. 4). Example: Micelles with disul\ufb01de cross-linked cores that degrade in the presence of intracellular glutathione. 3.5 Magnetic- Responsive Systems Mechanism: These systems incorporate magnetic nanoparticles that can be directed and heated by an external magnetic \ufb01eld, causing drug release through thermal or mechanical means. Example: Magnetic liposomes that release drugs upon exposure to an alternating magnetic \ufb01eld. 3.6 Electric- Responsive Systems Mechanism: These systems use materials that undergo electro- chemical reactions or changes in conductivity upon exposure to electric \ufb01elds, enabling controlled drug release.

The enzymatic action breaks down the carrier matrix or releases the drug from its conjugate. Example: Polymeric nanoparticles containing peptide sequences cleavable by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) overexpressed in tumors.", "Stimuli-Responsive Drug Delivery Systems: From Concept to Clinical Translation 137 Fig. 4 Mechanism of action of redox-responsive drug delivery system 4 Materials The phenomena that affect an activity at a speci\ufb01c location or target tissue to bring about bene\ufb01cial activities for the drug release via a variety of mechanisms is included in the stimuli-responsive drug delivery system. These materials are referred to as \u201cenvironmentally responsive materials\u201d or \u201cstimuli-responsive materials\u201d [4, 5]. See Fig. 5 for a visualization of different types of materials. 4.1 pH-Responsive Materials It is necessary for a pH-responsive drug delivery system (DDS) to protect the drug capsule while it is in the bloodstream (pH 7.3\u20137.4) and to release the drug or trigger particular actions (like cell-penetrating ability) when the tumor interstitial space (pH 6.8\u20137.2) or intracellular compartments (pH 4.5\u20135.5), endo- somes (pH 5\u20136), and cytoplasm (pH slightly above pH 7.0) are reached [115\u2013117]. Paclitaxel (PTX) and antagomir-10b were developed to be delivered via a pH-responsive antimicrobial peptide-mediated liposomal delivery system in mice with metastatic", "mammary tumor models. Antagomirs are single-stranded RNA analogues that have undergone chemical modi\ufb01cation and have been conjugated with cholesterol. This increases their stability and function by hybridizing with mature miRNA and inhibiting its activity [6]. One well-known cytotoxic drug is paclitaxel. The researchers attached [D]-H6L9, a previously reported pH-dependent antimicrobial peptide to the liposome surface [7]. pH-responsive materials can be developed using materials with ionizable groups, and these materials can be made using non-conventional techniques. When metformin hydrochloride (MH) was added to mesoporous bioglass (MBG) as a model drug, it effectively functions as a pH-responsive carrier. Afterward, hydroxyapatite (HAp) was added to the MBG pores at different concentrations and times to regulate the release of MH. Following drug loading and HAp mineralization, a decrease in pore size, volume, and surface area was observed. Pore size was also further decreased by longer mineralization durations and higher ion con- centrations, suggesting that prolonged mineralization and higher ion concentrations improve HAp mineralization Drug-loading ef\ufb01- ciency stayed unchanged despite the breakdown of HAp in acidic conditions, which changed the MH release pro\ufb01le based on miner- alization time and ion concentration. These observations suggest that this pH-responsive material is a promising carrier for therapeu- tic agents targeting tumors and in\ufb02ammatory sites [8]. Key exam- ples of materials that respond to pH are provided in Table 1. 138 Manisha et al.

Th", "ded in Table 1. 138 Manisha et al. Fig. 5 Classi\ufb01cation of various types of materials 4.2 Thermo- Responsive Materials Thermo-responsive materials exhibit changes in their physical properties or conformations in response to temperature variations. These materials are utilized in various biomedical applications, such as tissue engineering and drug delivery. However, the balance between hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties, as well as the", "interaction between the solvent and the polymer, affects the tem- perature at which these transitions take place. The thermo- responsive behavior of polymers can be modi\ufb01ed by introducing reactants into the polymer/solvent system, including additives like co-polymers, co-solvents, plasticizers, surfactants, and salts. These additives can affect the quality of the solvent, thereby altering the interactions between the solvent and the polymer [11].

The most well-known thermo-responsive natural polymer is gelatin. A possible delivery method for bone formation from BMP9-transduced mesenchymal stem cells is polydiolcitrate-gelatin scaffolds with thermos- responsive qualities [12]. Poly(N-alkyl substituted acrylamide) PNIPPAm nano\ufb01bers for release of doxorubicin were synthesized using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl)-1-carbodiimide hydro- chloride and N-hydroxysuccinimide as crosslinking agents [13]. Additionally, gelatin nanoparticles were created for the drug delivery of doxorubicin [14]. Thermo-responsive chitosan/\u03b2-gly- cerophosphate hydrogels were developed for the sustained delivery of venlafaxine hydrochloride [15]. 4.4 Synthetic Thermo-Responsive Materials They include PEG\u2013PPG\u2013PEG copolymer poly(N-vinyl-alkyl- amides), poly(N-alkyl substituted acrylamides), and PEG\u2013PLLA/ PD", "e hydrogels were developed for the sustained delivery of venlafaxine hydrochloride [15]. 4.4 Synthetic Thermo-Responsive Materials They include PEG\u2013PPG\u2013PEG copolymer poly(N-vinyl-alkyl- amides), poly(N-alkyl substituted acrylamides), and PEG\u2013PLLA/ PDLA\u2013PEG copolymer, among many others. An extensively stud- ied thermo-responsive polymers are based on PNIPAAm, a poly (N-alkyl substituted acrylamide). Gene therapy, tissue engineering, and drug delivery are just a few of the biomedical applications for PNIPAAm-based polymers (e.g., thermo-responsive polyplex micelles with PEG shells and PNIPAAm layers to protect DNA cores for gene therapy) [16]. Key examples of materials that respond to temperature are provided in Table 2.", "140 Manisha et al.

Different wavelengths, from UV to NIR, have been utilized for light-responsive materials. Although UV light is widely used, its detrimental effects and shal- low tissue penetration limit its applications. However, NIR light is better suited for biomedical applications due to its deeper penetra- tion and less toxicity to tissues [21]. Photoreactions offer spatio- temporal tunability, useful in therapeutics and dynamic cell culture system [22]. Depending on the kind of photochemical reaction occurring, light-responsive systems are classi\ufb01ed into four cate- gories [23]: photocleavage (breaking of covalent bonds), photo- thermal (dissipation of vibrational motion), photopolymerization (in situ crosslinking), and photoisomerization (structural changes). Photoisomerization is a reversible ", " into four cate- gories [23]: photocleavage (breaking of covalent bonds), photo- thermal (dissipation of vibrational motion), photopolymerization (in situ crosslinking), and photoisomerization (structural changes). Photoisomerization is a reversible process caused by UV and visible light and is frequently used with azobenzenes [24] and spiropyrans [25]. Photoexcitation of azobenzenes under UV light (365 nm) causes a transition from the trans to the cis form, which is utilized to destabilize different drug delivery vehicles such as den- drimers [26], micelles [27], and liposomes [28]. The cis conforma- tion disrupts the packing of these assemblies due to increased polarity and steric effects. To extend the effects of light stimulation and encourage the release of encapsulated drugs, a long cis lifetime is desired. Research studies have demonstrated that the trans-cis isomerization of an azobenzene derivative following its", "incorporation into liposomes can result in bilayer defects and the release of the entrapped payload [29\u201331]. Azobenzene-glycolipids incorporated into HSPC/DSPG/Chol liposomes have been shown to control drug release by light stimuli [31], maintaining the drug\u2019s stability while it is entrapped and instantly releasing almost all of the cargo when exposed to UV light. Furthermore, decyl-azobenzyl- triethylammonium and cholesterol sulfate-based \ufb02uid-phase photoresponsive nonphospholipid liposomes present a viable method for regulating multidose release via photocycling between the cis and trans azobenzene isomers [32]. These photoresponsive nonphospholipid vesicles have advantages over traditional phospholipid-based liposomes due to their distinct composition, including improved chemical stability and increased impermeability. Stimuli-Responsive Drug Delivery Systems: From Concept to Clinical Translation 141 The ortho-nitrobenzyl (o-nitrobenzyl) moiety is the widely used photocleavable molecule [33]. One instance consists of drug delivery micelles made of poly(S-(o-nitrobenzyl)-L-cysteine)-b- poly(ethylene glycol) block copolymers [34]. The o-nitrobenzyl groups are gradually photocleaved upon exposure to light at wave- lengths approximately 310 and 350 nm. This causes the self- assembled micelles to contract until they fully cleave, allowing the controlled release of the encapsulated drug through adjustment of the light exposure duration. This strategy is promising not only for developing light-responsive polypeptide-based block co-polymers but also for creating light-stimulated nanomedicine therapies. The nitrobenzyl group has also been incorporated into liposomes for drug delivery [35\u201337]. Light causes hydrolysis of o-nitrobenzyl results in the separation of hydrophobic an", "co-polymers but also for creating light-stimulated nanomedicine therapies. The nitrobenzyl group has also been incorporated into liposomes for drug delivery [35\u201337]. Light causes hydrolysis of o-nitrobenzyl results in the separation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups from the amphiphilic phospholipid, leading to destabilization of membrane and drug release. By grafting an azide tail precursor containing o-nitrobenzyl to an alkyne-functionalized lysolipid through a copper-catalyzed azide\u2013alkyne cycloaddition reaction, liposomes possessing photocleavable characteristics can be gener- ated in situ [35]. Photolysis of the integrated o-nitrobenzyl group changes the molecular structure of the photo-responsive phospho- lipid bilayer, increasing the phase transition and permeability of the membrane, which disrupts the liposome structure and releases the load. This in situ liposome production method creates photo- responsive liposomes for drug delivery by combining a click reac- tion with precursor design. Key examples of materials that respond to light are provided in Table 3. 4.6 Redox- Responsive Polymeric Materials Redox-responsive polymers can respond to biological stimuli gen- erated by oxidants or reductants found in the environment and can also react to changes in redox conditions or the application of an external voltage. Tetrathiafulvalene, viologens, organometallic compounds, and disul\ufb01de bonds are important chemical groups that contribute to their redox-responsive properties. These", "materials are used in biomedical applications such as drug delivery systems, speci\ufb01cally for cancer treatment, and the design of arti\ufb01cial muscles and self-healing materials.

The majority of the materials in the \ufb01rst group are iron oxides, also known as ferrite nanoparticles, which are usually arranged in crystalline forms like magnetite or maghemite. These particles are either ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic,", " rials [52]. The majority of the materials in the \ufb01rst group are iron oxides, also known as ferrite nanoparticles, which are usually arranged in crystalline forms like magnetite or maghemite. These particles are either ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic, but they resist self-agglomeration when their sizes fall below 128 nm. Instead, they behave like superparamagnetic particles. Particles smaller than 50 nm are referred to as ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (USPIONs) in this particular category, which is", "called superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) [53]. Because ferrite particles have relatively inert surfaces, coatings\u2014typically with silica\u2014are frequently necessary to increase their reactivity. This uses organosilane molecules to perform multi- ple covalent modi\ufb01cations with various functional groups. Research has demonstrated that silica-modi\ufb01ed magnetite nanoparticles (Fe3O4-MNPs) are produced by hydrolyzing tetraethyl orthosili- cate (TEOS) and retain a similar spherical shape and distribution to unmodi\ufb01ed MNPs. However, as more silica is added, the net satu- ration magnetization increases [54\u201356]. Compared to oxides, mag- netic metallic nanoparticles have a larger magnetic moment; however, they are more reactive to oxidizing agents and pyro- phoric, meaning they can self-ignite above 55 \u00b0C, which makes them challenging to work with [52]. Their surfaces can be passi- vated with protective layers using surfactants, polymers, precious metals, or mild oxidation to lessen these problems [57]. Stimuli-Responsive Drug Delivery Systems: From Concept to Clinical Translation 143 Monodisperse magnetic nanoparticles with excellent stability and shape-controllable sizes ranging from a few to tens of nan- ometers can be synthesized using top-down and bottom-up approaches [55, 58]. These methods are categorized into physical, chemical, and biological techniques. Chemical methods, part of the bottom-up approach, can be performed in both gas and wet phases. The most commonly used and cited wet phase methods include sol-gel processes, co-precipitation, hydrothermal synthesis, thermal decomposition, microemulsion, sonolysis, solvothermal, and elec- trochemical techniques [59]. Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are readily functionalized for a range of biological uses [59\u201363", " processes, co-precipitation, hydrothermal synthesis, thermal decomposition, microemulsion, sonolysis, solvothermal, and elec- trochemical techniques [59]. Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are readily functionalized for a range of biological uses [59\u201363]. An important characteristic that biocompatible MNPs should have been greater hydrophilicity, which will improve their water solubil- ity [57]. MNPs must \ufb01rst be stabilized in nonaqueous solvents using a hydrocarbon layer prior to surface functionalization. Then, techniques like ligand addition, ligand exchange, and hydro- philic silica coating can be used to achieve functionalization. To make MNP more soluble in water, the ligand addition method employs an amphiphilic molecule with both hydrophilic and hydro- phobic groups [64]. By forming a chemical bond with the surface, a novel kind of coordinating group replaces the hydrocarbon layer and adds a polar group that promotes water solubility in the ligand exchange process. The most ef\ufb01cient way to achieve biocompatibil- ity, stability, and hydrophilicity is the third technique, hydrophilic silica coating, which is usually achieved using the sol-gel process, which includes TEOS hydrolysis [55]. Key examples of materials that respond to magnetic \ufb01eld are provided in Table 5. 4.8 Electro- Responsive Materials Electro-responsive delivery systems (ESDSs) can be synthesized using drug carriers that align their dipoles when an electric poten- tial is applied. According to the literature, conducting polymers (ICPs) [70] and hydrogel [71, 72] are promising and potentially useful materials for these delivery systems.", "1, 72] are promising and potentially useful materials for these delivery systems.", "144 Manisha et al.

Electrostatic interactions can be utilized to incorporate the cationic drug into the polymer backbone [73]. One possible dopant to incorporate uncharged drugs into the ICPs is anionic \u03b2-cyclodextrin. 4.8.2 Hydrogels These gel networks are hydrophilic, meaning they can swell when a lot of water is absorbed into their polymeric structure. Because of their structure and hydrophilic nature, these macromolecular three-dimensional networks have high concentrations of ionizable groups within their polymer chains. While most electro-responsive hydrogels used are polycations, polyanions have also been investi- gated. These hydrogels can undergo deswelling, swelling, and ero- sion in response to variations in electric potential. 4.9 Enzyme- Responsive Materials Phospholipids have attracted a lot of interest as carriers in enzyme- responsive drug delivery systems (DDS), along with polymeric and inorganic nanomaterials. Enzyme-cleavable segments are present in the main chains or side groups of these nanomaterials. For example, nanoscale self-assembled materials are frequently combined with linkers that can be recognized by an enzyme or modi\ufb01ed by the enzyme\u2019s reaction product in order to design a drug delivery system with spatial and temporal control [74]. In inorganic nanosystems, active targeting ligands that interact with particular enzymes a", "at can be recognized by an enzyme or modi\ufb01ed by the enzyme\u2019s reaction product in order to design a drug delivery system with spatial and temporal control [74]. In inorganic nanosystems, active targeting ligands that interact with particular enzymes are used to impart enzyme sensitivity to nanoparticles [75, 76]. To release the drug in enzyme-responsive drug delivery system, an enzyme must change the structure or shape of the delivery vector. Because of their ability to break bonds, enzymes such as oxidor- eductases, phospholipases, and proteases\u2014in particular, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)\u2014are frequently studied in DDS. Poly- meric nanoparticles, liposomes, and inorganic nanoparticles like gold and capped mesoporous silica nanoparticles are common vec- tors for enzyme-responsive drug delivery systems. Another intriguing platform for enzyme-responsive delivery systems is gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Researchers functionalized the surface of AuNPs with a near-infrared \ufb02uorescence dye", "connected by a peptide substrate to create an apoptosis imaging probe [77]. The \ufb02uorescence was quenched when the caspase-3 enzyme was not present. Nevertheless, the quenched \ufb02uorescence was restored when caspase-3 cleaved the peptide substrate. In biomedical applications, this imaging probe showed great promise for apoptosis detection. Stimuli-Responsive Drug Delivery Systems: From Concept to Clinical Translation 145 5 Methods Over the past few decades, an excessive amount of research has been conducted on stimuli-sensitive drug delivery systems (DDSs). In this section, we will discuss the essential methods for designing smart drug delivery systems (SDDS). These advanced systems are designed to precisely regulate dose loading, ensure sustained release, accommodate individual variability, and enhance targeted permeability. SDDS exhibit dual or multi-responsiveness, respond- ing to both internal and external stimuli for improved drug delivery ef\ufb01ciency. 5.1 pH-Responsive Drug Delivery Systems pH-responsive DDS for cancer therapy can be synthesized with pH-cleavable bonds, such as acetal and hydrazone, added to the carrier through linkers or cross-linkers containing these bonds. Another method includes using ionic interactions for cross-linking hydrogels. For instance, ionic interactions can be used to cross-link polymeric precursors with basic or acidic groups, such as chitosan and alginate, respectively. Because these carriers include functional groups that undergo protonation or deprotonation in response to pH changes in the environment, they are susceptible to pH changes. The ionic connections between polymer chains and the ionic cross-linker are broken when an acidic pH is applied to a hydrogel composed of acidic polymeric precursors because the acidic functional gro", "e environment, they are susceptible to pH changes. The ionic connections between polymer chains and the ionic cross-linker are broken when an acidic pH is applied to a hydrogel composed of acidic polymeric precursors because the acidic functional groups get protonated. This causes the main structure of the hydrogel to break down and the anticancer medi- cations that are enclosed to leak out. Among the various mechan- isms, the change in the swelling degree of the hydrogel network is the most studied. To achieve this, the hydrogel network needs to contain basic functional groups that can be protonated at low pH levels, like those found in chitosan. Because of the electrostatic repulsion forces between positively charged functional groups, when these functional groups are protonated, osmotic pressure is created within the hydrogel network, causing the hydrogel to expand and change its degree of swelling. Furthermore, if the polymer has both basic and acidic functional groups, such as car- boxylic and amine groups, a change in pH will affect how much these groups are protonated or deprotonated. Depending on the pH level and the makeup of the polymeric precursors, this will either cause the hydrogel network to expand or contract [78].", "146 Manisha et al. 5.2 Redox- Responsive Drug Delivery Systems To synthesize redox-responsive drug delivery systems (RSDSs), disul\ufb01de bonds can be utilized as intermediate linkers within the carrier structure. Incorporating a drug into the polymer chains via a disul\ufb01de linker creates a redox-responsive delivery system. In bio- medical applications, micelles synthesized from poly(ethylene gly- col)-b-poly(caprolactone) (PEG-PCL) block co-polymer networks have garnered signi\ufb01cant attention for redox-responsive drug release. An effective biodegradable micelle-based system using PEG-SS-PCL block co-polymers has been synthesized for ef\ufb01cient intracellular delivery of doxorubicin (DOX). This system works by acting on the disul\ufb01de bonds between the polymeric blocks to cause glutathione (GSH) to selectively detach the PEG block from the carrier [79]. Furthermore, mesoporous silica nanoparti- cles (MSNs) are popular material for creating nanocarriers in cancer therapy because of their adjustable pore sizes, large surface area, and excellent biocompatibility. For example, collagen-capped MSNs have been used as redox-responsive nanocarriers to cleave disul\ufb01de linkers and release \ufb02uorescein isothiocyanate under con- trolled conditions as a model drug [80]. 5.3 Thermo- Responsive Drug Delivery Systems To synthesize thermo-responsive drug delivery systems (TSDSs), an external temperature stimulus is necessary for targeted delivery to tumor tissues. At a particular temperature, thermo-responsive hydrogels experience a reversible phase transition that modi\ufb01es their hydrophobicity, solubility, and conformation [81]. A variety of tools, such as light, microwave radiation, and hot water perfu- sion, are used to raise the outside temperature. Nevertheless, the penetration of these stimuli ", "sition that modi\ufb01es their hydrophobicity, solubility, and conformation [81]. A variety of tools, such as light, microwave radiation, and hot water perfu- sion, are used to raise the outside temperature. Nevertheless, the penetration of these stimuli into thick tissues is limited [82]. It has been shown that near-infrared (NIR) radiation is a useful external stimulus for enhancing TSDS performance. NIR can target tumor tissues speci\ufb01cally while causing the least amount of harm to healthy tissue [83]. A major obstacle in the development of TSDS is choosing a hydrogel that can absorb and transform NIR energy into heat [84]. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments are both present in ideal TSDS hydrogels. Because poly(N-isopropyl acryl- amide) (PNIPAM) has a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) above 32 \u00b0C, it shows great promise for use in biomedical applications [85]. Strong hydrogen bonds between amide func- tional groups and water molecules promote the dissolution of the polymeric network below the LCST. These hydrogen bonds rup- ture when the ambient temperature approaches or surpasses the LCST, which leads to the collapse of the polymer networks. 5.4 Magnetic- Responsive Drug Delivery Systems (MNPs) MNPs can be created using various methods, including electro- chemical approaches, microemulsion techniques, laser pyrolysis, and solvothermal/hydrothermal methods [86]. MNPs shows opti- mal performance when their size is below 20 nm, at which point they become superparamagnetic. Superparamagnetic nanoparticles", "are composed of a biocompatible polymeric coating that can be functionalized with drugs, antibodies, proteins, or plasmids, and a core composed of magnetic materials, particularly iron oxides [87]. Polymers such as polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), poly (N-isopropylamide) (PNIPAM), and polyethylene glycol (PEG) are applied to the surfaces of iron oxide nanoparticles because of their tendency to aggregate due to their hydrophobic nature. The spleen or the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) can readily eliminate large nanoparticles [86]. Superparamagnetic nanoparti- cles have zero magnetization in the absence of a magnetic \ufb01eld, which leads to high dispersion and inhibits aggregation and MPS recognition [88, 89]. Stimuli-Responsive Drug Delivery Systems: From Concept to Clinical Translation 147 A popular approach in the creation of magnetically responsive nanocarriers is to coat MNPs with thermos-responsive polymers such as PNIPAM and poloxamers. Through intramolecular inter- actions, the organic shell of these polymers holds drugs within its branches; heat from an alternating magnetic \ufb01eld (AMF) causes the polymer layer to collapse, freeing the trapped cargo. For example, thermos-responsive polymers have been used to create mesoporous silica nanoparticles [90]. The silica matrix was \ufb01lled with iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs), and the cargo was held in place by the silica mesopores. A thermostable polymeric shell consisting of N-isopropyl acryl- amide (NIPAM) and N-(hydroxymethyl) acrylamide (NHMA) in a 90:10 ratio was applied to the drug-loaded magnetic nanoparticles. This polymer transitions from linear to globular at 42\u201343 \u00b0C, which is in the range of hyperthermia. When exposed to AMF, poly (NIPAM/NHMA) can hold a signi\ufb01cant number of therapeutic agents inside the mesoporous s", "drug-loaded magnetic nanoparticles. This polymer transitions from linear to globular at 42\u201343 \u00b0C, which is in the range of hyperthermia. When exposed to AMF, poly (NIPAM/NHMA) can hold a signi\ufb01cant number of therapeutic agents inside the mesoporous silica matrix and release them. By increasing the amount of PEO (the hydrophilic block), poloxamers, which are poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(propylene oxide)-poly(ethyl- ene oxide) (PEO-PPO-PEO) triblock copolymers, can have their transition temperature adjusted between 19 and 100 \u00b0C. Chen et al. created magnetic, thermo-responsive, vitamin B12-loaded micelles using poloxamers [88]. Magnetically responsive nanocar- riers (MNPs) are coated with biopolymers to improve their bio- compatibility. Alginate hydrogel submicron beads were prepared by incorporating silica-coated MNPs using alginate, a naturally occur- ring polymer obtained from brown algae [91]. In a recent study, MNPs and antibiotics were embedded in polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate-cross-linked chitosan microbeads, enabling the release of antibiotics with tunable kinetics based on the cross-linker length, \ufb01eld strength, and frequency [92]. Elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) are one type of polypeptide that has temperature-responsive characteristics [93]. ELPs are com- posed of recurrent pentapeptide sequences, Val-Pro-Gly-X-Gly, where the polymer\u2019s transition temperature is in\ufb02uenced by the hydrophilic nature of X (any amino acid). Another biopolymer", "with a double helix that reacts to temperature is DNA. The four nucleotides that make up each DNA strand are adenine (A), cyto- sine (C), thymine (T), and guanine (G). The double helix, which splits at temperatures above the melting point, is formed by the Watson-Crick bonds connecting the A-T and G-C bases. Based on clusters of DNA-functionalized MNPs, Baglioni et al. created a controlled DNA release system [94]. 148 Manisha et al. An additional natural polymer called liposomes has been uti- lized to coat MNPs. To regulate the release of doxorubicin in tumor cells, for instance, magnetic liposomes functionalized with folate receptors were employed [95]. Another tactic is to directly bind therapeutic agents to MNP surfaces via temperature- responsive linkers. Medication molecules can be attached to MNPs through cycloaddition reactions, especially copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition, which releases the molecules when exposed to AMF. Using temperature-responsive linkers, the last tactic entails directly attaching medicinal spices to the surface of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). Cyclodextrins, especially thermos-reversible ones, are now widely used to functionalize MNPs. Drug molecules can be attached to MNPs using one such reaction, the azide-alkyne cycloaddition catalyzed by copper. An alternating magnetic \ufb01eld (AMF) can cause the drug molecules to be released from the nanoparticles [96]. 5.5 Light- Responsive Drug Delivery System One approach to designing a light-responsive DDS involves break- ing covalent bonds between nanoparticles and drug molecules using light. The photocleavable functional groups o-nitrobenzyl, pyrene, and coumarin have been studied the most. These moieties exhibit unique light-responsive properties and can shift the absorp- tion maximum to", "een nanoparticles and drug molecules using light. The photocleavable functional groups o-nitrobenzyl, pyrene, and coumarin have been studied the most. These moieties exhibit unique light-responsive properties and can shift the absorp- tion maximum to absorb light, primarily UV-vis irradiation, by utilizing substituent effects [97]. For example, coumarin- functionalized block copolymers have been used to create a UV-triggered biocompatible micellar DDS [98]. By using atom transfer radical polymerization to copolymerize coumarin methac- rylate and n-butyl methacrylate, this system was produced. Then, in the presence of light with a wavelength greater than 310 nm, the anticancer medication 5-\ufb02uorouracil was covalently bound to the coumarin. When UV light was applied at 245 nm, the medication was gradually released into the cancer cells. A different approach to creating light-responsive DDS is to modify the chemical structure. In these systems, noncovalent struc- tural alterations like trans-to-cis transformations and polarity shifts brought on by low-energy photons release cargo molecules that are noncovalently bonded to nanocarriers when exposed to near- infrared (NIR) radiation. When trans-to-cis transformation occurs, light induces a conformational change in the double bond within nanocarriers, thereby improving payload release. Azobenzene and its derivatives, which undergo reversible photoisomerization with", "different wavelengths of light, have been extensively studied as light-responsive groups [99]. To disassemble catanionic vesicles, the azobenzene moiety\u2019s con\ufb01guration has been changed [99, 100]. A light-responsive catanionic self-assembly system (mul- tilamellar and unilamellar vesicles) was created from sodium dode- cyl sulfate (SDS) and 4-cholesterocarbonyl-4\u2032-(N,N,N- triethylamine butyloxyl bromide) azobenzene (CAB). Rhodamine B and doxorubicin were released from the vesicles as a result of reversible isomerization of CAB under UV light exposure, which increased the interlamellar spacing. Stimuli-Responsive Drug Delivery Systems: From Concept to Clinical Translation 149 To release medication without photolysis, another tactic is to alter hydrophilicity. For instance, photooxidation serves as the basis for the release mechanism in unsaturated phospholipids. When unsaturated phospholipids are oxidized using singlet oxygen, their hydrophobicity is decreased, which causes instability and increases the permeability of the liposomes [101, 102]. Lovell et al. utilized the unsaturated phospholipid dioleoylphosphatidyl- choline (DOPC) for the controlled release of doxorubicin loaded in porphyrin-phospholipid (PoP) liposomes under NIR [103]. PoP, acting as the photosensitizer, generated active singlet oxygen, which led to an acceleration of DOX release when exposed to light at 665 nm. Singlet oxygen was con\ufb01rmed to be involved in the mechanism by the inhibition of drug release in the presence of an oxygen scavenger or antioxidant. 5.6 Electro- Responsive Drug Delivery Systems In the electro-responsive gel erosion mechanism, polyelectrolyte gels can be disintegrated in the presence of an electric \ufb01eld. These gels are made up of two water-soluble polymers that combine to form a", " 5.6 Electro- Responsive Drug Delivery Systems In the electro-responsive gel erosion mechanism, polyelectrolyte gels can be disintegrated in the presence of an electric \ufb01eld. These gels are made up of two water-soluble polymers that combine to form a hydrogel through ionic or hydrogen bond interactions. The formation of these materials is depended on pH of the environ- ment. For instance, a polyallylamine and heparin complex can form over a pH range of 3\u201310, but it breaks down at pH 11 [104]. Hydrogen bonds in the polyelectrolyte gel are broken by hydroxyl ions produced during the electrolysis of water when a cathode is positioned near it and an anode is positioned away from it [105]. The loaded drug is released as a result of the polymer complex eroding. Hydrogels generally have low poor conductivity, which hinders their performance as electro-responsive drug delivery systems (ESDSs). In order to improve the electrical conductivity of these hydrogels, conductive substances like graphene-based nanomater- ials, conducting polymers, and carbon nanotubes can be mixed into the polymer gel. Both single-walled and multi-walled carbon nano- tubes have been mostly used to enhance the mechanical strength and electrical properties of hydrogels [106, 107]. For instance, Yang et al. created conductive polypyrrole-reinforced hyaluronic acid hydrogels, which improved their electrical conductivity and biocompatibility for use in biomedical applications", "[108]. Moreover, to enhance the functionality of an electrorespon- sive delivery system, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) has been com- posited with polyethylene glycol diglycidyl ether and Jeffamine polyetheramine [109]. When rGO is present, the electrostatic repulsion increases at a negative applied potential, hastening the release of the drug from the composite. 150 Manisha et al. 5.7 Enzyme- Responsive Drug Delivery Systems Enzyme-responsive polymeric nanoparticles have been created for the treatment of diseases such as diabetes and cancer. For example, 4-hydroxymandelic acid was utilized as the framework to construct enzyme-responsive linkers [110]. The drug and enzyme substrates were attached to the hydroxyl groups in the mandelate core. An enzyme found in the infected cells caused the linker to break, releasing the conjugated drug spontaneously. The work of Wong et al. provides another illustration of enzyme-responsive DDS uti- lizing polymeric nanoparticles [111]. Liposomes have garnered signi\ufb01cant interest as superior drug delivery vehicles due to their numerous bene\ufb01ts, such as their large surface areas, appropriate sizes, and distinct chemical characteristics. By conjugating with targeting ligands that interact with receptors on the surface of the treated cell, liposomes can either passively or actively accumulate in target tissues. For example, Wan et al. reported a matrix metallo- proteinase (MMPs)-responsive liposomal formulation for gene delivery. An MMP-cleavable peptide was used as the linker to functionalize PEG chains into anionic liposomes containing adenovirus [112]. 6 Conclusion Recent studies on the differences between pathological areas, including tumors, and normal areas have observed that pathologi- cal regions exhibit abnormal conditions such as c", "G chains into anionic liposomes containing adenovirus [112]. 6 Conclusion Recent studies on the differences between pathological areas, including tumors, and normal areas have observed that pathologi- cal regions exhibit abnormal conditions such as changes in pH, temperature, and redox states, along with the downregulation or overexpression of certain receptors and transporters. These signi\ufb01- cant alterations provide novel opportunities for creating smart drug delivery systems (DDS) that are stimuli-responsive. Medications can be put into specialized carriers that react to external stimuli such as magnetic and electric \ufb01elds or to the abnormal conditions of pathological areas. The smart carriers have the ability to change physically and chemically in response to these stimuli, which can lead to the controlled and selective release of the drug payload. To avoid or reduce unintended off-target effects on non-target tissues, a deeper comprehension of the stimuli sensitivity of these designed DDS is still required. One of the upcoming challenges in the development of new DDS is creating systems that can react to particular biomarkers at extremely low concentrations. Future chal- lenges in developing new DDS include investigation of cutting-", "edge nanotechnology-based personalized medicine techniques, combination therapies, and new stimuli. Additionally, the design and development of multifunctional DDS for simultaneous diag- nosis and therapy of diseases will be another important approach. Improve the biocompatibility, stability, and speci\ufb01city of systems that respond to stimuli in order to make them more suitable for clinical use.

Originally used in medical devices for tissue replacement or organ support, their applications have expanded beyond mere implantation. Biomaterials, which can be natural or synthetic, are designed to interact with biological systems, supporting or replacing damaged tissues while being compatible with human biology. Over time, advancements in material science have led to signi\ufb01cant innovations in their use, particularly in drug delivery systems. Biomaterials now enhance the effectiveness of therapeutic agents like antibodies, peptides, and vaccines, and are applied in tissue engineering, prostheses, and dental implants. Recent research has focused on biomaterials as nanocarriers for controlled drug delivery, minimizing drug degradation and toxicity while optimizing therapeutic outcomes. As biocompat- ibility remains a crucial factor, new developments in biomaterials offer promising solutions for enhancing drug delivery, wound healing, and overall patient care. Key words Biomaterials, Drug delivery, Biocompatibility, Tissue engineering, Therapeutic agents 1 Introduction From the last few decades, biomaterials have marked its presence in the fast-advancing pharmaceutical and medical \ufb01elds. Biomaterials are those materials which are intended to interact with biological living tissue and used for therapeutic and diagnostic purpose. Ear- lier these materials were only used in medical devices to treat or to replace any tissue or improve the functions of organ. But later it was found that the term non-viable given to them is inappropriate as bioma", "erapeutic and diagnostic purpose. Ear- lier these materials were only used in medical devices to treat or to replace any tissue or improve the functions of organ. But later it was found that the term non-viable given to them is inappropriate as biomaterials have its application more than just as implanted devices. Biomaterials are a major part of our routine practice in the diagnosis as well as for the treatment of several human diseases. Biomaterials are basically, any materials (natural or synthetic) that are biologically compatible with the human body and is used to support, enhance, restore, or replace the biological function of damaged tissues and is continuously in contact with the body \ufb02uids. The use of the word \u201cbiomaterials\u201d had been largely anticipated by Abhishek Pathak and Satya Pal Singh (eds.), Next-Generation Drug Delivery Systems, Methods in Pharmacology and Toxicology, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-4554-3_8, \u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025 159", "the practical use of materials as biomaterials. Indeed, the presence of exogenous materials in the human body can be dated back to prehistory. In South Africa and India, the heads of large, biting ants were exploited to clamp wound edges together [1]. Over the centuries, other metals have been exploited: lead and silver among others, with and without evidence of adverse reactions. Moreover, 4000 years ago, the Chinese carved bamboo sticks in the form of natural teeth to be inserted into jaws just like current dental implants. Egyptians used precious metals for dental implants [2]. 160 Naveen Kumar Additionally, the purpose to replace diseased/damaged parts of the human body has been pursued for centuries. During the six- teenth century, Gaspare Tagliacozzi and other pioneering plastic surgeons successfully used autogenous skin \ufb02aps to replace missing noses [3]. All these original surgical procedures had been per- formed without any awareness of the problems and limitations related to material science and biological phenomena; moreover, no knowledge of sterilization, immunological reaction, in\ufb02amma- tion, and biodegradation was available at those times [1]. However, their \u201cunconscious\u201d success clearly demonstrates that the human body has an impressive ability to adapt itself and accommodate foreign materials. This allowed for traveling on the road to bioma- terials evolution before taking into account the fundamental inter- actions between the body and the implanted materials; the systematic examination thereof only began about 150 years ago, when scientists and physicians started to scienti\ufb01cally evaluate how the body reacts to the presence of exogenous materials. The practi- cal exploitation of materials as biomaterials then began to face the issue of biocompatibility.", "ut 150 years ago, when scientists and physicians started to scienti\ufb01cally evaluate how the body reacts to the presence of exogenous materials. The practi- cal exploitation of materials as biomaterials then began to face the issue of biocompatibility. 2 Evolving De\ufb01nitions of Biomaterials As was described in the previous paragraph, biomaterials are char- acterized by a wide range of chemical compositions and properties, and they can be exploited in very many applications. Therefore, it is quite dif\ufb01cult to de\ufb01ne them unambiguously. Marin et al. [4] ascribed to Jonathan Cohen one of the earliest de\ufb01nitions of bio- materials, which dates back to 1967. Dr. Cohen was an orthopedic surgeon and exogenous materials had been used in orthopedic surgery for many years. He simply de\ufb01ned \u201cbiomaterials\u201d as all materials that are used as implants, with the exception of drugs and soft biological tissues [5]. Indeed, this de\ufb01nition comes from the practical use of biomaterials in surgery focusing on \u201chard\u201d materials that are typically applied in orthopedics. In April 1974, the Society for Biomaterials (SFB) was formally established and organized its inaugural annual symposium at Clem- son University (SC, USA) [6]. In this symposium, a new de\ufb01nition of biomaterial was coined: \u201cA biomaterial is a systematically,", "pharmacologically inert substance designed for implantation within or incorporation with a living system\u201d [7]. A broader de\ufb01nition was formulated in 1982 during the \u201cNational Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference Statement on the Clinical Applications of Biomaterials\u201d (Bethesda, MD, USA): biomaterial is \u201cA substance (other than a drug) or combination of substances, synthetic or natural in origin, which can be used for any period of time, as a whole or as a part of a system which treats, augments, or replaces any tissue, organ, or function of the body\u201d [8]. The differ- ence from a drug is maintained, but now the de\ufb01nition includes materials of \u201cnatural\u201d origin and speci\ufb01es what biomaterials are intended for: they are part of a system that is conceived not only to replace but also to potentially treat and augment each tissue, each organ, and each function of the body. Biomaterials in Drug Delivery: Design and Applications 161 As an immediate consequence, possible applications increase as much as the availability of biomaterials increases. In this aspect, the de\ufb01nition given by Prof. D. F. Williams \u201cA biomaterial is a non-viable material used in a medical device, intended to interact with biological systems\u201d seems to be more appropriate [9]. Besides the current use of biological tissues from human cadavers (tissue banks) and from animals (after chemical treatments), tissue engi- neering techniques appear as extremely promising approaches to create viable tissues (and organs) by combining cells, scaffolds (biomaterials!), and biochemical signals. During the European Society for Biomaterials 9th European Conference (Chester, UK) in 1991, the de\ufb01nition, approved in 1982, was improved including \u201cin order to maintain or improve the quality of life of the individ", "erials!), and biochemical signals. During the European Society for Biomaterials 9th European Conference (Chester, UK) in 1991, the de\ufb01nition, approved in 1982, was improved including \u201cin order to maintain or improve the quality of life of the individ- ual\u201d [10]. It clearly af\ufb01rms that the aim of any biomaterial is not only the \u201csurvival\u201d of the patient but also the maintenance/ improvement of their quality of life. 3 Basic Features Required for the Biomaterial Since the biomaterials are in direct contact with the body tissues and body \ufb02uid, there are some basic features required for the biomaterial such as biocompatibility, inertness, safety, stability, cost effectiveness, and ease of fabrication as shown in Fig. 1. 4 Characteristics of Biomaterials The requirement of designing and selection criteria of biomaterial depends upon the type of medical application. The biomaterial must have some unique characteristics that can have potent appli- cation in biomedical \ufb01eld for longer duration without immune rejection (Fig. 1). Some of these characteristics are described here [11, 12].", "162 Naveen Kumar Fig. 1 Diagrammatic demonstration of substance design requirements of biomaterials 1. Outstanding biocompatibility 2.

The ISO 10993-1 establishes criteria for the biological evaluation of medical devices, again con\ufb01rming that biological tests have to be \u201cper- formed on the \ufb01nal medical device, or representative samples from the \ufb01nal device or materials processed in the same manner as the \ufb01nal medical device (inc", "ological evaluation of medical devices, again con\ufb01rming that biological tests have to be \u201cper- formed on the \ufb01nal medical device, or representative samples from the \ufb01nal device or materials processed in the same manner as the \ufb01nal medical device (including sterilization, if needed)\u201d [13]. Thus, the term \u201cbiocompatibility\u201d has to include not only what is commonly meant as \u201cbiological compatibility\u201d but also a functional evaluation of the entire implantable system. For sure, several aspects determine the biocompatibility of a given material also considering the duration of the contact with the biological", "counterparts: chemical composition, mechanical behavior, and also physical shape. 164 Naveen Kumar 7 Biomaterials in Drug Delivery The expeditious development of science and technology has led the application of biomaterials in different \ufb01elds of biology, physics, chemistry, tissue engineering, as well as medicine [14, 15]. From last 50 years, biomaterials have been researched and used in phar- maceutical drug delivery and found to enhance the delivery and effectiveness of many therapeutic agents along with antibodies, peptides, vaccines, and enzymes [16]. Biomaterials play an impor- tant role in diverse \ufb01elds like medicines, food manufacturing units, pharmaceutical companies, fashion designing, and other household appliances. In the area of medical sciences, biomaterials are signi\ufb01- cantly applied in dental \ufb01xture fabrication, implants, prosthesis, and tissue scaffolds. In pharmaceutical sector, in addition to the pro- duction of tablets and capsules, these biomaterials are employed in the designing of customized implants for drug delivery [17]. Biomaterials have a huge number of advantages and are used for nanocarriers which have good biocompatibility, good biode- gradability, high drug-loading capacity, and pH-responsive drug release ability, and, therefore, are used for the drug delivery [18]. The well-designed drug delivery systems by synthetic biomin- eral nanocarriers can help prevent the prior leakage of drug and protect the drug from inactivation during the circulation. Biomineral-based nanocarriers are used for the delivery of chemo- therapeutic drugs, genes, and proteins [18]. Nano\ufb01brous bioma- terials are used for drug delivery because of their great potential and structural features that are same to extracellular matrix. Different natural as well as polymer", " delivery of chemo- therapeutic drugs, genes, and proteins [18]. Nano\ufb01brous bioma- terials are used for drug delivery because of their great potential and structural features that are same to extracellular matrix. Different natural as well as polymeric materials can be used to make nano\ufb01- brous biomaterials [19]. The central nervous system (CNS) depends on the state of neural cells and also on various extracellular components which arranges the cellular behavior into proper tissue functions. Biomaterials have a crucial role in regaining or increasing the role of extracellular components in CNS for the event of injury and disease. Biomaterials are also used for cell transplantation as well as for the delivery of proteins or drug [20]. The components derived from extracellular matrix are emerging as origin of bioma- terials for engineering, which are able to induce desired cell-speci\ufb01c response. Use of various biomaterials that are derived from natu- rally available extracellular matrix proteins for regulating the cell function has been reported [21]. Corti et al. [22] have developed patches from polyacrylate as a biomaterial for the transdermal drug delivery through the high internal phase emulsion technique for the wound healing. Kim et al. [23] have developed atenolol", "imprinted polysaccharide biomaterial by using mungbean starch and polyvinyl alcohol and evaluated them for drug release behavior. Biomaterials in Drug Delivery: Design and Applications 165 For making effective formulation of a drug, it should be kept in mind that the active constituent is present at the target site in maximum amount inside the human body. It has been observed that in the pharma sector the drug delivery system depends on several factors like the delivery device or dosage form, and the active component at the requisite site of action. The consumption of tablets and capsules as conventional dosage is restricted by the requirement of elevated doses that coupled with higher toxicity pro\ufb01les. To remove this obstacle, a novel drug therapy has been developed. In novel drug therapy, the active ingredient is modu- lated in such a way that it confers maximum advantage to the target site and side effects get minimized. Some examples based on this therapy comprises of nano-formulations, liposomes, microspheres, and osmotic drug delivery systems. These can be applied as oral administration or parenteral use. Mucoadhesive drug delivery sys- tem is another example that is based on transdermal applications [24]. The quest for controlled drug release emanating from side effects associated with the application and delivery of conventional drugs has necessitated the need for materials that can transport drugs to target site without dif\ufb01culty or problem during and after delivery. Normally, drugs are delivered repeatedly on prescription to the body in measures that will bring about remediation and quick recovery to the patient during the treatment period. In this way, drug concentration levels will increase and when above the body\u2019s tolerance level, the problems associated w", "ription to the body in measures that will bring about remediation and quick recovery to the patient during the treatment period. In this way, drug concentration levels will increase and when above the body\u2019s tolerance level, the problems associated with over therapeu- tic concentrations could occur that could result into toxic side [25]. It is also possible that the drug release rate is so fast that therapeutic actions are no longer effective owing to low drug concentrations at the delivery site, which may occur through drug metabolism, degradation, and transport out of the target [25]. Consequently, this phenomenon would result in drug wast- age and transport medium loss with high-risk offside effects on surrounding body cells, tissues, and organs. The solution to these problems is to have drug carriers that can provide controlled release rate to the target and would allow for complete therapeutic reha- bilitation before degradation and transport of excess concentration of drug and carrier medium [26]. The drug and its carrier in form of capsules are orally administered and may be formulated for parenteral administration [16]. The drug release rate of the capsule can be controlled via the use of cellulose coatings exhibiting slow dissolution, incorporation of drug-complexing elements or com- pounds which hinder fast dissolution of drug, use of compressed tablets, and the inclusion of emulsion and suspensions. Materials that can permit drug release without changing or decaying over time with longer therapeutic windows (days to years) are required.", "to years) are required.", "These carries are such that they can be injected and/or implanted directly to target diseased tissues/cells for enhancing delivery ef\ufb01- ciency [27]. To achieve target drug delivery, the use of af\ufb01nity ligands deposited on biomaterial surfaces to allow for a set reten- tion and usage by in\ufb01rm tissues and cells have been employed [28]. The design of biomaterials for drug carriers aside permitting surface modi\ufb01cation using ligands should also shield drugs from speedy break down and/or degeneracy within the target site. 166 Naveen Kumar 8 Controlled Drug Delivery With the emergence of genetic engineering in the 1970s, large- scale production of proteins and other complex macromolecules became a reality. Similar to small-molecule delivery, controlled release of proteins and other macromolecules (i.e., insulin, heparin, enzymes) required the development of new biomaterials or new biomaterial designs. Synthetic materials were required that could ensure the delivery of proteins and macromolecules in unaltered forms to preserve their biological function, while simultaneously providing protection from degradation in vivo. Furthermore, it was largely thought within the controlled release community that pro- teins and other macromolecules could not be encapsulated and released at controlled rates from polymers. Polymers are large molecules formed from simple monomers and may be synthetic or biopolymers that are the constituents of living organisms like proteins, nucleic acids, and sugars. Biopolymers are active in controlling and regulating many biochemical and biophysical functions of living cells, and thus can participate in cooperative interactions, resulting in nonlinear response to external stimuli. The cooperative interaction mecha- nism of biopolymers is utilized in producin", "ting many biochemical and biophysical functions of living cells, and thus can participate in cooperative interactions, resulting in nonlinear response to external stimuli. The cooperative interaction mecha- nism of biopolymers is utilized in producing synthetic polymers that are similar in behavior to biopolymers, which are used as biomaterials with ability to interface with biological systems for a variety of living cells functions. Polymeric, biodegradable materials are often useful in biomedical applications, as the polymers degrade into normal metabolites of the body or eliminated from the body with or without further metabolic transformation [29, 30]. Devel- oped polymeric biomaterials have physical and chemical properties that are maintained and are not tampered with during synthesis. The use of synthetic polymeric biomaterials includes arti\ufb01cial cor- neal substitute, blood contacting devices, hip joint replacements, and formation of intraocular lenses [31, 32]. Biodegradable poly- mers are either natural or synthetic. Natural polymers are derived from natural resources and have potential to be considered for biomedical and pharmaceutical applications owing to biocompati- bility, biomimicking environments, unique mechanical properties, and biodegradability. Natural polymers are prone to viral infection,", "antigenicity, and unstable material supply, which limit biomedical application. On the other hand, synthetic polymers are \ufb02exible in synthesis procedure technique with excellent reproducibility which made them useful for surgical and short-term medical application, orthopedic applications that may slowly transfer the load as it degrades [33]. The drug administration into the body is either via an oral or intravenous route with repeated administration done to increase concentration and performance. But this may reach an extreme level before it declines rapidly, especially when the elimina- tion rate from the body is high. A too low or too high drug concentration in the body will not bene\ufb01t the patient because of the side effects. This phenomenon then becomes a concern requir- ing the use of controlled drug release mechanism which can only be offered by biomaterials [34]. For controlled drug release, the ther- apeutic and bioactive agents are enveloped or encapsulated in an insoluble biodegradable subnano, nano, micropolymer matrix cav- ity where the therapeutic agents are released in a controlled fashion. These pioneering technologies led to rapid progress in the \ufb01elds of biomaterials and drug delivery, with the development of a new generation of polymers which release macromolecules in a con- trolled manner. Biomaterials in Drug Delivery: Design and Applications 167 9 Clinical Need for Controlled Drug Delivery The need for materials for controlled drug release arose from the general problems associated with conventional dose delivery meth- ods. Generally, drug administration required frequent, repeated doses that result in high variability of circulating drug concentra- tions throughout the treatment period (Fig. 2). Upon administration, drug levels increase to therapeu", " delivery meth- ods. Generally, drug administration required frequent, repeated doses that result in high variability of circulating drug concentra- tions throughout the treatment period (Fig. 2). Upon administration, drug levels increase to therapeutic con- centrations, but in some cases, toxic side effects arise when the concentration rises above the maximum safe levels [25]. These methods also result in rapid drug level decreases to concentrations that are no longer therapeutic, which can be a result of metabolism, degradation, and transport away from the therapeutic target [25]. Collectively, this results in both wasted drug and material, and increased risk to patients due to reduced therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy as well as potential toxic side effects [35]. To address these issues, approaches for slowing the rate of release were developed [26]. These \u201csustained release\u201d technologies contained the desired therapeutic in the form of capsules which were generally adminis- tered orally, and in some cases formulated for parenteral adminis- tration [16, 35]. Drug release was dampened through the use of slowly dissolving cellulose coatings, the addition of drug-complexing substances to decrease drug solubility, the use of compressed tablets, as well as the employment of emulsion and suspensions, all housed within capsules. Sustained release", "formulations, however, still were in\ufb02uenced strongly by patient-to- patient variability, environmental effects, and required repeated dosages [35]. 168 Naveen Kumar Fig. 2 Schematic representation of drug plasma levels after various dosing regimens As an alternative to sustained release, the ideal controlled drug release system offers several advantages. Such delivery materials release drugs at rates that do not change with time (i.e., zero- order release), maintaining release within the therapeutic window and avoiding the inef\ufb01ciencies of the drug concentration peaks and valleys of conventional formulations (Fig. 2). By avoiding \u201cpeaks and valleys\u201d and remaining within the therapeutic window, con- trolled release materials provide the bene\ufb01t of reducing the total amount of drug required to achieve therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy. By decreas- ing the number of required doses, these materials would also improve patient adherence, which is only 50% in developed nations [36]. By controlling drug release over longer therapeutic windows (i.e., days to years), such materials can also be injected and/or implanted directly within a speci\ufb01c diseased tissue, thereby limiting off-target side effects and increasing potency. In addition to avoid- ing \u201cpeaks and valleys,\u201d controlled release systems must enhance the targeting of drugs to speci\ufb01c tissues and cells within the body to avoid off target effects [27, 37]. To enhance tissue speci\ufb01city, active targeting strategies utilizing af\ufb01nity ligands on the surface of bio- materials have been employed for speci\ufb01c retention and uptake by", "or speci\ufb01c retention and uptake by", "diseased tissues and cells [28]. In this approach, ligands that bind to surface molecules or receptors overexpressed in diseased cells and tissues are selected for and conjugated to delivery materials [38]. Materials designed for controlled release should ideally also protect drugs from rapid clearance and/or degradation within the body. Biomaterials in Drug Delivery: Design and Applications 169 Developing such biomaterials for controlled release is challeng- ing and requires a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating engi- neers, physical scientists, biologists, and clinicians [39]. Design parameters include: 1. The incorporation of adequate drug within the host material for prolonged release pro\ufb01les that are required to achieve ther- apeutic ef\ufb01cacy 2. Protection of therapeutics from breakdown in vivo while also maintaining biological activity 3. Predictable release over the course of the therapeutic regimen, ranging from days to years. Additionally, the materials themselves and their degradation products should be nontoxic and biocompatible within the body, avoiding patient discomfort prior to and following administration. The expense of a particular material-drug formulation, due to the cost of material synthesis and/or fabrication, must also be taken into account during the design phase. 10 Biomaterials for Controlled Release of Small Molecules Initial studies describing the incorporation of bioactive molecules into solid polymeric materials for achieving a sustained release pro\ufb01le were conducted in the 1950s and 1960s for agricultural applications [35]. Soon thereafter, polymeric biomaterials as con- trolled drug release systems for medical applications were pioneered in the 1960\u201370 s [40]. The \ufb01rst reported biomaterial for controlled molecule release was silicon", " for agricultural applications [35]. Soon thereafter, polymeric biomaterials as con- trolled drug release systems for medical applications were pioneered in the 1960\u201370 s [40]. The \ufb01rst reported biomaterial for controlled molecule release was silicon rubber when it was observed that hydrophobic, lipophilic, small-molecule (molecular weight <300 g/mol) dyes diffused through the wall of silicon tubing [41]. Given that medical-grade silicones are biocompatible and used for implantation for a range of medical applications, this discovery led to the use of silicone rubbers for the controlled release of drugs, including atropine, histamine, anesthetics, steroids, and antimalarial and antischistosomal agents [42\u201344]. Notably, implanted silicone rubber released drugs over the course of days to months in dogs, rats, and sheep [42, 43, 45], demonstrating that biomaterials induce controlled release of biologically active agents in the body. These reports suggested that modulating pharmaco- logical actions by controlling drug release from biomaterials could", "be achieved, ultimately leading to the formation of ALZA in 1968 for the commercialization of some technologies [41]. This work further led to the development of an early drug delivery system approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1990, Norplant (now Jadelle), a contraceptive composed of silicone rubber tubes implanted in the forearm that releases levonorgestrel for up to 5 years with pregnancy rates of less than 1% per year [46]. Research within the \ufb01eld of biomaterials, drug delivery, and controlled release accelerated during this period, giving rise to the development of osmotic pumps for oral drug delivery in dogs [47], drug-loaded hydrogels for ophthalmic drug delivery [48], poly- meric and albumin microsphere-based encapsulation for sustained release of drugs in rats, rabbits, and humans [49], as well as new mathematical models to quantify drug release from biomaterials [50]. Hydrogels, 3D networks of polymer chains cross-linked to form matrices with high water content, are now widely used in drug delivery and tissue engineering due to their tunable physical, chem- ical, and biological properties [51]. Broadly speaking, hydrogels demonstrate application in areas such as regenerative medicine [52]. In drug delivery, PEG has been utilized as a \u201cstealth material\u201d that enhances the circulation half-life of drugs, reduces drug accu- mulation in clearance organs such as the liver, while also enhancing the surface biocompatability of materials [53]. More comprehen- sive overviews on hydrogels [51, 54], as well as the history of biomaterials for drug delivery and controlled release, are detailed elsewhere [55]. 170 Naveen Kumar 11 Bioresponsive Polymers: From Design to Implementation An ideal therapeutic drug is expected to treat or cure a disease withou", "ll as the history of biomaterials for drug delivery and controlled release, are detailed elsewhere [55]. 170 Naveen Kumar 11 Bioresponsive Polymers: From Design to Implementation An ideal therapeutic drug is expected to treat or cure a disease without resulting in any side effects [56]. However, this goal has not been achieved so far. Many chemotherapeutics are found to destroy both cancerous and healthy cells within the vicinity of the target site [57]. An ef\ufb01cient chemotherapeutics would administer drug directly to diseased cell populations. Polymers have been found to permit the creation of \u201cresponsive\u201d materials within the host environment and can be formulated with drugs to control release [58]. This polymer attribute is due to tuning propensity of the molecular weight of polymers that can be controlled via mono- mer stoichiometry using controlled polymerization strategies like atom transfer radical polymerization, reversible addition fragmen- tation chain transfer, nitroxide-mediated polymerization, and living ring-opening metathesis polymerization. A bioresponsive material is one that can respond to a speci\ufb01c \u201ctrigger\u201d inside or outside of the body. Because the body have unique pathological parameters such as pH gradients, temperatures, enzymes, and small molecules, the creation of materials that will respond to physiological", "alterations in both space and time is required. Triggers include chemical, biological, and physical stimuli. The chemical and biological ones are intrinsic to the body, while the physical stimuli are extrinsic to the body and can thus be used to quicken sole drug delivery [59]. Biomaterials in Drug Delivery: Design and Applications 171 11.1 Redox- Sensitive Polymers The human body consists of compartmentalized regions of differ- ing redox potential. The reducing agent glutathione, for example, is found at a concentration two to three orders of magnitude larger within cells than outside of them. Bio-responsive materials are initiated by redox potential difference in tissue environment and its surrounding [60]. Contrastingly, oxidizing agents that include hydrogen peroxide are associated with tissue in\ufb02ammation and injury [61]. These differences in redox potential between a local tissue/cellular environment and their surroundings present an opportunity to create bioresponsive materials that are triggered via oxidation or reduction within the body. In order to respond to reduction triggers within the body, materials derived from dis- ul\ufb01des are commonly employed [60]. Disul\ufb01de-based materials are frequently used as bioresponsive materials because disul\ufb01de bridges can be reduced under mild conditions to afford dithiol analogues. Within the cell, this process is most commonly mediated by gluta- thione, a tripeptide consisting of glycine, cysteine, and glutamic acid. To date, dilsu\ufb01de-based materials have been exploited for applications ranging from protein delivery to gene expression, among others [62]. Importantly, disul\ufb01de/dithiol interchange is a reversible chemical reaction which can be important for biomedical applications. Interestingly, many sulfur-based materials hav", "ations ranging from protein delivery to gene expression, among others [62]. Importantly, disul\ufb01de/dithiol interchange is a reversible chemical reaction which can be important for biomedical applications. Interestingly, many sulfur-based materials have also been developed to respond to oxidation triggers. Sulfur is a unique atom in that it can exist in multiple oxidation states; accordingly, sulfur-based materials including block copolymers have been prepared for applications in areas such as gene delivery [63]. Alter- natively, materials derived from boronic acids/esters have also been developed to respond to oxidation triggers [64]. In the presence of oxidizing agents such as hydrogen peroxide, boronic acids/esters can be converted into the corresponding alcohol. This chemical process has been exploited for triggered protein release applications using dextran as a base material, among others. There are materials that can respond to both oxidation and reduction triggers, which are incorporated into responsive polymers. One of the most com- mon functional group motifs used for these dual activation materi- als are diselenides. Diselenides are similar in chemical structure to disul\ufb01des and have also been incorporated into responsive poly- mers. Unlike disul\ufb01de materials, however, diselenides are sensitive to both oxidation and reduction, which allows for alternative trig- gers within nanobiotechnology application [65].", "172 Naveen Kumar The constituents of the human body such as tissues, \ufb02uids, and organelles have varied pH values. Areas like stomach, vagina, and lysosomes display acidic pH (<7.0), ocular surfaces (7.1), blood (7.4), and bile (7.8) [58]. Owing to these varied pH of systems and organs in the body, improvement in the ef\ufb01cacy and precision of therapeutic molecules will necessitate the design of polymeric drug delivery systems that are pH speci\ufb01c. pH-responsive materials have been useful in nucleic acid delivery, doxorubicin delivery, and taste masking [66]. The target treatment of tumors has been enhanced using the pH-responsive materials. Such known target delivery includes multifunctional acid-sensitive nanocomposites for antican- cer drugs and acid-responsive poly ethylene glycol derivatives for the controlled release of therapeutics in tumor target treatment [67]. As a general strategy to create pH-sensitive materials, it is common to incorporate chemical functional groups that can be protonated or deprotonated within polymeric matrices [68]. For example, amine-containing polymers including those derived from dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate are protonated under acidic con- ditions to yield reversibly cationic materials [69]. By contrast, carboxylate-containing polymers including poly(acrylic acid) are deprotonated under basic conditions to afford anionic matrices. Given that the charge of these polymers can be readily altered, materials derived from these polymers can respond to pH changes by swelling, degrading, shrinking, or dissociating. In doing so, these materials can release their drug cargo in a pH-responsive fashion within target tissues and organs in the body. To date, pH-responsive materials have been used for a variety of applications including nucleic acid ", " or dissociating. In doing so, these materials can release their drug cargo in a pH-responsive fashion within target tissues and organs in the body. To date, pH-responsive materials have been used for a variety of applications including nucleic acid delivery, doxorubicin delivery, and taste masking, among others [66]. 11.2 pH-- Responsive Polymers One speci\ufb01c area where pH-responsive materials have improved therapeutic targeting is in the treatment of tumors. The tumor microenvironment often exists at a lower pH (\u22485.7) than its sur- roundings (\u22486.8\u20137) due to localized acidosis [70]. Given this difference, multifunctional acid-sensitive nano-composites have been explored for the controlled release of anticancer drugs [71]. Importantly, these materials were also functionalized with folic acid, improving the targeting of these materials to overex- pressed folic acid receptors on the cancer cell surface. Moreover, a similar concept has been employed for materials incorporating acid- sensitive diaminoketal cross links, and drug-laden versions of these materials have demonstrated increased cellular uptake relative to that observed for the free drug alone [72]. Finally, acid-responsive poly(ethylene glycol) derivatives have also been designed for the controlled release of therapeutics using hydra-zine chemistry, and tumor targeting with pH-responsive materials continues to be an area of interest to the drug delivery community [67].", "Biomaterials in Drug Delivery: Design and Applications 173 11.3 Hydrolysis and Enzymatically Responsive Polymers Hydrolysis-sensitive polymeric materials have also been designed, synthesized, and implemented in vivo for drug delivery purposes. Hydrolysis-prone materials by de\ufb01nition can be degraded by water, a trigger that is ubiquitous in the human body. This degradative process most commonly occurs through the nucleophilic addition of water into an electrophilic functional group on a polymer. Com- monly employed electrophilic functional groups on polymers include esters and anhydrides, each of which have been employed in multiple types of responsive materials [73]. The Gliadel wafer is one example product on the market that demonstrates the power of hydrolysis-sensitive materials for drug delivery [74]. Consisting of the chemotherapeutic Carmustine impregnated within a polyanhy- dride material, the Gliadel wafer can be implanted into brain tumors for the controlled release of chemotherapeutic to malignant gliomas. Of note, the Gliadel wafer improves the 6-month survival rate of patients diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme [74]. Enzyme-responsive polymers have also been developed for drug delivery. The concentrations of speci\ufb01c enzymes including matrix metalloproteins, hyaluronidases, phospholipases, and prostate-speci\ufb01c antigen can deviate from normal values in associa- tion with speci\ufb01c disease pathologies. Accordingly, many enzyme- responsive polymer systems have been developed, with applications ranging from tumor imaging, to doxorubicin delivery, and mini- mizing in\ufb02ammation in the colon, among others [75]. 11.4 Temperature- Responsive Polymers Another drug delivery vehicle is the temperature-sensitive polymer that can operate at both human body temperature of ", "aging, to doxorubicin delivery, and mini- mizing in\ufb02ammation in the colon, among others [75]. 11.4 Temperature- Responsive Polymers Another drug delivery vehicle is the temperature-sensitive polymer that can operate at both human body temperature of 37 \u00b0C and at ambient temperature such as 25 \u00b0C. To take advantage of this difference, polymer systems that \ufb02ow at room temperature but become gel at body temperature have been developed\u2014these mate- rials are predominantly used for local delivery applications, capita- lizing on the sol-gel transition of speci\ufb01c polymers [76]. These polymers include poloxamers, poly(N-alkyl acryl amides), poly (N-vinyl caprolactams), cellulose, xyloglucan, and chitosan. These thermo-responsive polymers can be modi\ufb01ed via varying the ratio of monomers, endgroup modi\ufb01cations, and post-polymerization modi\ufb01cations to make them suitable for varying applications [77]. 11.5 Magnetic- Responsive Polymers Magnetic-responsive polymers are therapeutic drug-loaded poly- mers that work under the in\ufb02uence of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to deliver its drug to the target. Magnetic pulsing techni- ques serve as yet another \u201ctrigger\u201d for controlling the release of drugs from responsive materials. This concept has been extended to designing systems to release compounds to speci\ufb01c organs by pair- ing therapeutic treatment with drug-loaded polymers and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques [78]. Select examples include (i) the systematic release of dopamine from alginates impregnated with magnetic beads; (ii) targeted plasmid delivery to the lung", ") targeted plasmid delivery to the lung", "using chitosan nanoparticles; and (iii) insulin delivery, among others [79]. Magnetic \u201ctriggers\u201d have also been combined with pH-responsive materials to afford dual responsive drug delivery systems. The combination of two or more environmental responses in a single material can be highly advantageous. For example, if one were to include magnetic particles within a polymer that was designed to degrade in highly acidic conditions, then one could use MRI imaging to pinpoint the exact location that the drug was delivered upon dispersion of the particles within, for instance, the stomach. An added bene\ufb01t to incorporating magnetic material within a delivery nanoparticle is that it can double as a retrieval method. When designing any material or drug that will be implanted in a patient, it is important to establish a contingency plan. In case of an undesired immune response or rejection, for both molecular chemicals and living tissue alike, being able to remove the injected or implanted material is crucial. Having a magnetic system allows for the material to be more easily removed, especially in a self-circulating system (e.g., the blood stream or intraperitoneal spaces). Accounting for these factors into a drug\u2013 polymer design broadens the project scope and challenges interdis- ciplinary research in order to achieve a uni\ufb01ed engineered material. It is also important to note that some magnetic responsive systems have been approved by the FDA [80]. 174 Naveen Kumar 11.6 Light- Responsive Polymers Light-responsive polymers are used as external drug delivery sys- tems that use noninvasive and painless techniques as drugs are delivered by light UV- and visible-wavelength irradiation stimula- tion. The ease by which drugs can be delivered by light stimulation has been a major motiv", "s external drug delivery sys- tems that use noninvasive and painless techniques as drugs are delivered by light UV- and visible-wavelength irradiation stimula- tion. The ease by which drugs can be delivered by light stimulation has been a major motivation for the design of systems to respond to this style of noninvasive trigger. Light stimulation drug delivery has been desirable due to the controlled spatial and temporal release of a therapeutic payload with both UV- and visible-wavelength irradi- ation. This technique provides a remote-activated approach that does not require direct patient contact [81]. Current challenges associated with light-activated controlled drug release include the distance of the polymer vehicle from the light source, the density of native host tissue that the light has to penetrate to reach the delivery vehicle, and the potential for drug molecule degradation upon exposure to light. One underlying mechanism of light- induced drug delivery involves a shift in molecular conformation including cis-trans isomerization and ring-opening reactions [82]. This technology has been used to target melanoma cells through the release of drugs from a light-responsive azobenzene- modi\ufb01ed amphiphilic block copolymer [83]. Upon irradiation, the conformation of the azobenzene switches, thereby altering the self- assembling structures and releasing the payload.", "Biomaterials in Drug Delivery: Design and Applications 175 11.7 Swelling and Contracting Polymers There are polymers that can swell or shrink in response to external stimuli. Changes in porosity can result from leaching of ionic cross- linking molecules, which in turn alters the diffusion pathways for sensing molecules [84]. This phenomenon can have stemmed from changes in porosity occasioned as ionic cross-linking molecules are leached, resulting in alteration of the diffusion pathways for sensing molecules. Alginate, a commonly employed polymer that is isolated from seaweed, is relatively biocompatible. Tuning the spatial and temporal release of encapsulated materials is rather challenging, but has been successfully applied for a variety of applications using alginates. A recent example includes the sustained delivery of vas- cular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and subsequent analogues from alginate to a localized region within the body. Using an injectable alginate design, the controlled release of VEGF was utilized to promote lymphatic vessel development through improved vascularization [85]. In general, these hybrid designs have the potential to create future generations of materials for the paralleled delivery of therapeutics, regional speci\ufb01c sensing, and secondary responses for noninvasive detection. 12 Transdermal Drug Delivery Systems Conventional (\u201cfree\u201d) drugs exhibit limitations that can be improved through their incorporation in drug delivery system. The chemical nature of the drug molecule can be responsible for its poor solubility resulting in drug precipitation when in aqueous media. The use of drug carriers such as lipid micelles or liposomes, among others, can surpass this major limitation improving drug solubility (Lukyanov and Torchilin 2004). Al", "e for its poor solubility resulting in drug precipitation when in aqueous media. The use of drug carriers such as lipid micelles or liposomes, among others, can surpass this major limitation improving drug solubility (Lukyanov and Torchilin 2004). Although many efforts have been developed to promote topic/transdermal drug delivery, the systemic route is still the major strategy used for drug adminis- tration. A drug administered by this method reaches the systemic circulation (blood) inducing, therefore, a systemic action. On the other hand, drugs given by the topical route are mainly applied on skin or mucous membrane, being able to promote both of systemic and localized action. 12.1 Barriers to Transdermal Delivery Skin is a highly ef\ufb01cient barrier that limits molecular transport both from and into the body, preventing molecular permeation. This natural barrier avoids the penetration of foreign molecules such as the \ufb02ux of toxins, while minimizing the water loss. Skin is com- posed by multi-layers. On skin\u2019s outer surface, there is a non-living layer of keratin-\ufb01lled cells surrounded by a lipid-rich extracellular matrix named stratum corneum (SC), an extremely thin biomembrane.", "176 Naveen Kumar 12.2 Development of Transdermal Drug Delivery Patches Transdermal delivery systems can be divided into three generations of development. As stated in European Pharmacopoeia, transder- mal patches are designed to provide the controlled and sustained release of active substances to the systemic circulation after crossing the skin barrier, mostly by diffusion and resulting in a prolonged and adequately constant absorption rate. The majority of the actual patches are within the \ufb01rst generation. 12.3 Hydrogels Versus Non-hydrogel Polymeric Patches Matrix- and reservoir-type patches can be divided into hydrogel and non-hydrogel polymeric patches. Hydrogel is a water-swollen and cross-linked polymeric network produced by the simple reaction of one or more monomers. Hydrogels have received high attention in the past 50 years, due to their exceptional promise in wide range of biomedical applications [48]. 12.4 Patches Based on Biopolymers Biopolymers, mostly natural ones, have been receiving careful attention due to their biocompatibility, being editable, low toxicity, and susceptibility to degradation by human enzymes or by hydro- lysis, as well as renewable and sustainable giving rise to a broader use especially in \ufb01elds such as biomedical sciences, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and other related \ufb01elds. 12.5 Patches Based on Synthetic Polymers The commercially available patches are based on synthetic materials that display greater mechanical resistance and non-degradation over time. These materials can be widely used in different patches design such as drug-in adhesive (DIA) and microneedles patches. The DIA patches consist in the incorporation of a drug and possible additives in pressure sensitive adhesives (PSA) that is limited by a backing \ufb01lm and release lin", " in different patches design such as drug-in adhesive (DIA) and microneedles patches. The DIA patches consist in the incorporation of a drug and possible additives in pressure sensitive adhesives (PSA) that is limited by a backing \ufb01lm and release liner. 12.6 Drug Particles/ Carriers Drug release is greatly conditioned by the physical and chemical properties of the drug. Carrier systems ranging from micro- to nanoscale are able to transport a wide variety of therapeutic mole- cules with enhanced solubility and targeting. Such systems can be incorporated during patch production in order improve drug release, enhancing its permeation through skin layers. Nanovesi- cles, for instance, allow the delivery of the entrapped molecules into or across the skin. 12.7 Commercial Patches New and desired products are commercialized to ful\ufb01l the unmet medical needs at a reasonable cost. Approximately two dozen molecules have been approved for transdermal administration by the regulatory authorities to reach the market. Most of these drugs are for prescription use only, with many being available as generic patches following patent expirations. The development of new and effective DDS has been greatly improving treatments ef\ufb01cacy, solving the common problems asso- ciated with the use of conventional \u201cfree\u201d drugs. Their", "administration through transdermal route has been attracting con- siderable attention due to its numerous advantages, such as less frequent, painless, and \ufb02exible dosing, as it also generates less amount of dangerous waste. These factors have been stimulating the research and development of transdermal DDS to be effective. Biomaterials in Drug Delivery: Design and Applications 177 13 Smart Biomaterials Another class of innovative biomaterials that are pushing forward pioneering medical approaches are the ones taking the name of smart biomaterials, due to their ability to respond to changes in physiological parameters or external stimuli [86\u201388]. These bio- materials are able to modify their physicochemical and mechanical properties as a reaction to biological, chemical, and physical signals, i.e., temperature, humidity, pH, redox potential, enzymatic activity, light, and mechanical stimuli. Among these biomaterials, smart hydrogels are frequently exploited for tissue engineering and drug delivery applications [89\u201391]. Indeed, the hydrogel structure can be cross-linked also using reversible methods, such as physical cross-linking, thermally induced entanglement, and self-assembly, which may allow for controlling drug release and biodegradation rate [92, 93]. Biodegradable hydrogels are often obtained by means of cleavable cross-linkers, which can be dissolved through hydroly- sis, proteolysis, or disentanglement following a speci\ufb01c stimulus [94]. Other biomaterials such as shape memory (SM) alloys and polymers own the unique ability to recover to their original geom- etry and structure after exposure to an external stimulus, such as temperature, magnetic \ufb01eld, electric \ufb01eld, light, or relative humidity [95]. Electroactive polymers (EAPs) are another emerging class of sma", "ability to recover to their original geom- etry and structure after exposure to an external stimulus, such as temperature, magnetic \ufb01eld, electric \ufb01eld, light, or relative humidity [95]. Electroactive polymers (EAPs) are another emerging class of smart materials that have attracted attention as actuators for the development of arti\ufb01cial muscles. These polymers present some similarities with the functional response of biological muscles in terms of resilience, resistance, and large actuation stretching or bending [96, 97]. Nanomaterials and nanostructured biomaterials have also been adopted in bioinspired robotics to simulate speci\ufb01c actuation and sensing properties, such as, by way of example, the tactile features of human skin or the ability of some animals to sense subtle vibrations in the environment [98]. One of the most recent applications of biomaterials to regenerative medicine is represented by their use as systems to release extracellular vesicles (EVs) and soluble factors [99]. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are pluripo- tent progenitor cells that are able to self-renew, differentiate into multiple lineages, and also accomplish trophic effects [100]. These effects are due to the secretion of EVs, which transport a variety of intracellular molecules (lipids, proteins, RNA, and DNA) suitable for guiding the regenerative process during tissue repair. These", "molecules control different cellular functions (e.g., migration, pro- liferation, differentiation, and synthesis of extracellular matrix com- ponents); furthermore, they suppress the local immune system, inhibit \ufb01brosis and apoptosis, enhance angiogenesis, and stimulate mitosis and differentiation of reparative cells. 178 Naveen Kumar 14 Conclusion and Future Perspective Signi\ufb01cant progress has been made in improving the biomaterial- based drug delivery systems. However, only a limited number of af\ufb01nity-based delivery systems have been developed for the delivery of neurotrophic factors. Therefore, there is a need for the develop- ment of broad-spectrum reservoir-based delivery systems, includ- ing microspheres, electrospun nano\ufb01bers, hydrogels, and combinations of these systems. Drug delivery systems transport biologically active agents, such as growth factors and genetic mate- rial, into the desired location to promote bene\ufb01cial effects for the treatment of diseases and disorders, osmotic pumps for the delivery of neurotrophic factors to target site, af\ufb01nity-based delivery systems (ABDS) in which drug loading and controlled release are achieved through the interactions of therapeutic drug and the delivery sys- tem, and reservoir-based delivery systems, where a polymer struc- ture encapsulates the drug while its release is controlled via the material properties. Skin provides a large and readily accessible surface area for application and absorption of a patch-like device to its surface, constituting a noninvasive procedure that will promote a continu- ous intervention. Transdermal DDS have been exploited as a suc- cessful controlled drug release platform that have received regulatory approval for a series of products. Transdermal DDS can be applied when a drug has a si", "that will promote a continu- ous intervention. Transdermal DDS have been exploited as a suc- cessful controlled drug release platform that have received regulatory approval for a series of products. Transdermal DDS can be applied when a drug has a signi\ufb01cant \ufb01rst-pass effect in the liver, being prematurely metabolized. Such type of drug delivery also allows for less frequent dosing or steady delivery pro\ufb01les and may be easily applied with a painless application. Moreover, trans- dermal DDS promote a fast absorption of drug in super\ufb01cial tissues, improving the wound healing process. The choice among these patches can mostly depend on the drug properties (e.g., molecular weight and physicochemical characteristics), as well as the required amount and release rate to accomplish an effective treatment. Drug carriers (either at nano- or micro-scale) can be incorporated in patches in order to improve drug pharmacological properties, prompting a more ef\ufb01cient treatment of such devices. Signi\ufb01cant progress has been made in improving the properties of hydrogels used for drug delivery and expanding the range of drugs and kinetics which can be achieved using a hydrogel-based delivery vehicle. However, several challenges remain to improve the clinical applicability of hydrogels for drug delivery. One set of major", "challenges relates to improving the ease of clinical usage. Designing physical gelators which gel at lower polymer concentrations and at more precise gelation temperatures would reduce the risk of pre- mature gelation inside the needle upon injection. Similarly, for covalently cross-linked hydrogels, the further development of stra- tegies to release cross-linker in a triggered manner inside the body would minimize the risk of syringe clogging, improve the localiza- tion of cross-linker release to minimize in vivo toxicity, and enable mixing of the chemically reactive gel precursors in a single syringe, eliminating the need for double-barreled syringes. Improvements in this domain could also be achieved by developing better applica- tor systems for the hydrogels. The application of new physicochem- ical strategies (or combinations of existing cross-linking techniques) to simultaneously control not only the gelation process but also the interactions between the gel and the native tissues would further expand the utility of injectable hydrogels for both drug delivery and tissue engineering-based applications. There is a need for continued improvement in the delivery of not only hydro- phobic molecules, but also the delivery of more sensitive molecules such as proteins, antibodies, or nucleic acids which can readily be deactivated or unfolded by interactions with the hydrogel delivery vehicle. Progress on any or all of these challenges would greatly expand the potential of hydrogel-based drug delivery to success- fully deliver the next generation of designed drugs at the desired rate and location in the body.

This method is more useful in the area of pharmaceutics and therapeutics because it involves the delivery of drugs through the skin to avoid the gastrointestinal tract and \ufb01rst-pass metabolism to improve bio- availability and to reduce side effects [1].", "s method is more useful in the area of pharmaceutics and therapeutics because it involves the delivery of drugs through the skin to avoid the gastrointestinal tract and \ufb01rst-pass metabolism to improve bio- availability and to reduce side effects [1]. The skin has a large surface area and is the best target for drug administration because it allows for drug administration and controlled release of the drug for a prolonged period of time [2]. The practical application of transdermal drug delivery systems (TDDS) is based on knowledge of the skin structure and its barrier properties, which are processes of overcoming this biological barrier for drug delivery.

Transdermal drug delivery is an adopted method of giving the patient drugs through the skin onto their systemic circulation. In this case, the skin barrier is created by the use of patches, gels, or any other local drug formulation to convey the drugs to the blood. Transdermal drug delivery is based on controlled, sustained passive diffusion through various layers of the skin. 1.1 Historical Evolution Over the past few decades, transdermal drug delivery systems have undergone substantial advancements. The \ufb01rst transdermal patch designed for motion sickness using scopolamine emerged in the 1970s. A major breakthrough occurred in the 1980s with the introduction of nicotine patches to aid smoking cessation [3]. The 1990s saw an expansion of transdermal delivery applica- tions encompassing hormonal therapy and pain management. Since the 2000s, research efforts have concentrated on creating cutting- edge technologies, such as microneedles and iontophoresis, to improve the ef\ufb01cacy of drug absorption through the skin. 1.2 Bene\ufb01ts and Constraints Transdermal drug administration presents numerous advantages over conventional drug delivery methods. It bypasses hepatic \ufb01rst-pass metabolism, enables controlled and continuous drug release, and improves patient adherence owing to its noninvasive nature [4]. Furthermore, this technique allows for easy discontinu- ation of treatment when needed and decreases dosing frequency. Nevertheless, transdermal drug delivery has limitations. It is con\ufb01ned to medications with particular physicochemical character- istics that allow effective skin barrier penetration.

It is con\ufb01ned to medications with particular physicochemical character- istics that allow effective skin barrier penetration. Moreover, some patients may experience skin irritation or allergic responses [5]. 2 Skin Anatomy and Physiology 2.1 Cutaneous Layer Organization The skin is composed of three main layers: the epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis. The outermost layer of the epidermis is a strati\ufb01ed squamous epithelium comprising several sublayers including the stratum corneum, stratum lucidum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, and stratum basale. The topmost sublayer, the stratum corneum, is crucial for barrier function [6]. Beneath the epidermis lies the dermis, which consists of connective tissues including blood vessels, nerve endings, hair follicles, and glands. These components provide structural support and nourishment to the skin. The hypo- dermis, also known as the subcutaneous layer, is primarily com- posed of adipose tissue and serves as an insulator for energy storage.", "Transdermal Drug Delivery: Technology and Applications 187 2.2 Cutaneous Barrier Function The barrier function of the skin is predominantly attributed to the stratum corneum, which consists of corneocytes embedded in a lipid matrix. This structure is frequently described using a \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d model, wherein corneocytes represent the bricks and intercellular lipids form the mortar [7]. The barrier function pro- tects against water loss, microbial invasion, and penetration of harmful substances [8]. The lipid matrix, which is composed of ceramides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids, plays a crucial role in maintaining skin hydration and regulating permeability [9]. Fur- thermore, the acidic pH of the skin, typically ranging from 4.5 to 6.5, contributes to its antimicrobial properties and aids in maintaining the integrity of the stratum corneum [10]. 2.3 Factors In\ufb02uencing Drug Permeation Drug permeation through the skin is a complex process in\ufb02uenced by multiple factors categorized into three main groups: physico- chemical properties of the drug, formulation factors, and biological factors. The physicochemical properties of a drug are critical in determining its ability to penetrate the skin barrier. Molecules with molecular weights of less than 500 Da and moderate lipophi- licity (log P between 1 and 3) generally exhibit superior skin permeation [11]. The drug\u2019s ionization state also affects its perme- ation, with unionized molecules demonstrating greater penetration than ionized molecules. These properties collectively determine the capacity of the drug to overcome the skin\u2019s natural barrier function and reach the underlying tissues or systemic circulation. Formulation and biological factors exert a signi\ufb01cant in\ufb02uence on drug permeation through the skin. The selec", "determine the capacity of the drug to overcome the skin\u2019s natural barrier function and reach the underlying tissues or systemic circulation. Formulation and biological factors exert a signi\ufb01cant in\ufb02uence on drug permeation through the skin. The selection of the vehicle, drug concentration, and incorporation of penetration enhancers in the formulation substantially affect the rate and extent of drug permeation. Vehicle selection is critical because different vehicles can enhance drug solubility or alter skin barrier properties. For instance, lipophilic vehicles, such as mineral oil, can increase the partitioning of lipophilic drugs into the stratum corneum, whereas hydrophilic vehicles, such as propylene glycol, can enhance the solubility of hydrophilic drugs. Drug concentration also plays a crucial role, as higher concentrations generally lead to increased permeation owing to a greater concentration gradient. However, this relationship is not always linear, because saturation effects may occur at very high concentrations. Penetration enhancers are compounds that can disrupt the structure of the stratum corneum and facilitate drug passage. For example, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) can increase the \ufb02uidity of intercellular lipids, whereas urea can increase skin hydration and keratolytic effects. Biological factors also play a critical role in drug permeation. Skin hydration can enhance permeation by improving drug solubility in the stratum corneum. Occlusive dressings or humectants, such as glycerin, can increase skin hydration and potentially enhance drug absorption. Elevated skin temperatures", "nd potentially enhance drug absorption. Elevated skin temperatures", "can increase molecular kinetic energy and blood \ufb02ow, potentially enhancing drug absorption [12]. This effect is often utilized in transdermal drug delivery systems that incorporate heat-generating components. 188 Pabbathi Shivakumar et al. Table 1 Common permeation enhancers used in transdermal formulations Category Examples Mechanism of action Alcohols Ethanol, propylene glycol Increase drug solubility, extract lipids Fatty acids Oleic acid, linoleic acid Disrupt lipid packing in stratum corneum Terpenes Menthol, limonene Increase lipid \ufb02uidity Surfactants Sodium lauryl sulfate Solubilize lipids, denature keratin Urea Urea, dimethyl urea Increase hydration of stratum corneum Increased local blood \ufb02ow can enhance drug absorption by maintaining a concentration gradient across the skin. Vasodilators or physical methods, such as massage, can increase local blood \ufb02ow. The integrity of the skin barrier signi\ufb01cantly affects drug perme- ation. Compromised skin, such as in cases of eczema or psoriasis, may allow for increased drug penetration compared to intact skin [13]. The anatomical site is also important because skin thickness and appendage density vary across different body regions, thereby affecting drug permeation. For instance, the skin on the face and genitals is generally more permeable than that on the palms or soles. Age can also in\ufb02uence skin permeability, with infant skin often being more permeable than adult skin, whereas elderly skin may have reduced barrier function. These factors interact in complex ways, and their combined effects must be considered when designing transdermal drug deliv- ery systems (Table 1). For example, a formulation may combine a suitable vehicle (e.g., ethanol) with a penetration enhancer (e.g., menthol) and be applied to a highly perme", "r combined effects must be considered when designing transdermal drug deliv- ery systems (Table 1). For example, a formulation may combine a suitable vehicle (e.g., ethanol) with a penetration enhancer (e.g., menthol) and be applied to a highly permeable anatomical site (e.g., behind the ear) to maximize drug permeation. Understand- ing these interactions is crucial for developing effective transdermal drug delivery systems. 3 Mechanisms of Transdermal Drug Delivery Transdermal drug delivery systems utilize various mechanisms to facilitate the transport of therapeutic agents across the skin barrier, providing a noninvasive and convenient method for drug adminis- tration. These systems have garnered signi\ufb01cant attention owing to their potential to overcome the limitations associated with oral and parenteral routes of drug delivery. The mechanisms underlying", "transdermal drug delivery are complex and multifaceted and involve numerous physiological and physicochemical processes. Transdermal Drug Delivery: Technology and Applications 189 1. Passive diffusion represents the primary and most prevalent mechanism, relying on the concentration gradient between the drug formulation and the skin. This process involves the movement of molecules from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration, without energy expenditure. The rate of passive diffusion is in\ufb02uenced by several factors, includ- ing molecular weight, lipophilicity, and thickness of the stra- tum corneum of the drug. Molecules with lower molecular weights and higher lipophilicities tend to diffuse more readily through the lipid-rich intercellular spaces of the stratum cor- neum. The stratum corneum, the outermost layer of the epi- dermis, serves as the primary barrier to drug penetration and plays a crucial role in determining the rate and extent of passive diffusion. Passive diffusion can be further subdivided into transcellular and intercellular pathways. In the transcellular pathway, drug mole- cules traverse through corneocytes and the lipid matrix surround- ing them. This route is generally favored by small hydrophilic molecules. Conversely, the intercellular pathway involves the move- ment of molecules through the continuous lipid domains between corneocytes. Lipophilic drugs typically prefer this route because of their af\ufb01nity for lipid-rich environments. 2. In contrast to passive diffusion, active transport involves the utilization of energy-dependent carrier proteins to transport drugs across the skin barrier against a concentration gradient. Although less common in transdermal delivery, this mechanism can be exploited for speci\ufb01c molecules that s", "port involves the utilization of energy-dependent carrier proteins to transport drugs across the skin barrier against a concentration gradient. Although less common in transdermal delivery, this mechanism can be exploited for speci\ufb01c molecules that serve as substrates for naturally occurring transporters in the skin. Active transport has the potential to enhance the delivery of larger or more hydrophilic molecules, which would otherwise encounter dif\ufb01- culties in passively penetrating the skin. This mechanism is particularly relevant for peptides and proteins, which are typi- cally too large to passively diffuse through the stratum corneum. Active transport in the skin can occur through various trans- porters, including ATP-binding cassette (ABC) and solute carrier (SLC) transporters [14]. These transporters are found in different layers of the skin and can facilitate the movement of speci\ufb01c mole- cules across cellular membranes. The expression and activity of these transporters can vary depending on factors such as skin con- dition, age, and disease state, potentially in\ufb02uencing the ef\ufb01cacy of transdermal drug delivery systems that rely on active transport mechanisms.", "190 Pabbathi Shivakumar et al. 3. Facilitated diffusion represents an intermediate mechanism wherein speci\ufb01c carrier proteins or channels assist in the move- ment of drugs across the skin without direct energy expendi- ture. This process can accelerate the transport of certain molecules compared to passive diffusion alone, particularly for drugs that bear a close resemblance to endogenous sub- stances recognized by these facilitator proteins. Facilitated dif- fusion can be especially bene\ufb01cial for polar molecules that would otherwise struggle to penetrate the lipophilic stratum corneum. The facilitated diffusion process involves the binding of drug molecules to speci\ufb01c carrier proteins or channels, which then undergo conformational changes to transport molecules across the membrane. This mechanism is saturable and exhibits selectivity based on the structural characteristics of the drug molecules. Exam- ples of facilitated diffusion in transdermal drug delivery include the transport of glucose and amino acids through speci\ufb01c carrier pro- teins in the skin. In addition to these primary mechanisms, several other factors can in\ufb02uence transdermal drug delivery. For instance, the hydration state of the stratum corneum can signi\ufb01cantly affect drug penetra- tion. Increased hydration can lead to swelling of corneocytes and disruption of lipid bilayers, potentially enhancing drug permeation. Temperature changes can also affect drug delivery by altering the \ufb02uidity of lipid bilayers and increasing skin blood \ufb02ow, which can enhance drug absorption. Various enhancement techniques have been developed to improve transdermal drug delivery. These include chemical enhan- cers that can disrupt the structure of the stratum corneum or alter its lipid organization to increase permeability. P", " absorption. Various enhancement techniques have been developed to improve transdermal drug delivery. These include chemical enhan- cers that can disrupt the structure of the stratum corneum or alter its lipid organization to increase permeability. Physical methods such as iontophoresis, which uses a small electric current to drive charged drug molecules across the skin, and microneedles, which create temporary microchannels in the skin, have also shown prom- ise in enhancing transdermal drug delivery [15]. A comprehensive understanding and manipulation of these mechanisms are essential for optimizing transdermal drug delivery systems and expanding the range of therapeutics that can be effec- tively administered. This may involve selecting appropriate drug candidates based on their physicochemical properties, developing novel carrier systems that can interact with skin transporters, or incorporating enhancers that can modulate skin barrier function. 4 Formulation Strategies for Transdermal Drug Delivery Transdermal drug delivery systems aim to overcome the limitations of oral and injectable routes by providing controlled release,", "improved bioavailability, and reduced side effects. Formulation strategies play a crucial role in enhancing drug permeation through the skin barrier and optimizing therapeutic outcomes. Transdermal Drug Delivery: Technology and Applications 191 4.1 Drug Selection Criteria The selection of appropriate drugs for transdermal delivery is criti- cal for the ef\ufb01cacy of a transdermal drug delivery system (TDDS). Several key parameters must be evaluated when assessing the suit- ability of a drug for transdermal administration. Primarily, the molecular weight of the drug should preferably not exceed 500 Da, as larger molecules encounter dif\ufb01culties in penetrating the stratum corneum. Additionally, the drug should possess bal- anced lipophilicity, with an octanol-water partition coef\ufb01cient (log P) ranging between 1 and 3, to ensure adequate solubility in both lipid and aqueous environments [16]. This equilibrium facilitates ef\ufb01cient partitioning into the stratum corneum and subsequent diffusion into the deeper skin layers. Drug potency is another crucial factor, as transdermal delivery is constrained by the available application surface area. Drugs with high potency that require daily doses below 10 mg are generally more appropriate for transdermal delivery [17]. The melting point of the drug is also signi\ufb01cant, with lower melting points (<200 \u00b0C) being preferable, as they often correlate with enhanced solubility and skin permeability [18]. Furthermore, the drug should exhibit a favorable therapeutic index to minimize the toxicity risks associated with potential variations in absorption rates. The pharmacokinetic pro\ufb01le of the drug warrants consideration as well. Drugs with short half-lives or those requiring frequent dosing are often suitable candidates for transdermal delivery,", "ks associated with potential variations in absorption rates. The pharmacokinetic pro\ufb01le of the drug warrants consideration as well. Drugs with short half-lives or those requiring frequent dosing are often suitable candidates for transdermal delivery, as this route can provide sustained release and reduce dosing fre- quency [19]. Lastly, the drug should not induce signi\ufb01cant skin irritation or sensitization, as these effects can compromise patient compliance and diminish the ef\ufb01cacy of TDDS. 4.2 Vehicle and Excipient Considerations The selection of appropriate vehicles and excipients is fundamental for the formulation of effective transdermal drug delivery systems. The vehicle serves as a carrier for the drug and in\ufb02uences its release characteristics, whereas excipients enhance its solubility, stability, and permeation through the skin [20]. When choosing a vehicle, formulators must evaluate its com- patibility with the drug, capacity to maintain drug stability, and ability to facilitate drug release and skin penetration. Common vehicles for transdermal formulations include hydrophilic and lipophilic bases, such as creams, gels, ointments, and patches. Hydrophilic vehicles, such as hydrogels, are frequently employed as water-soluble drugs and can provide a cooling effect upon appli- cation [21]. Lipophilic vehicles such as mineral oil-based ointments are suitable for lipophilic drugs and can enhance skin occlusion, potentially improving drug penetration [22].", "192 Pabbathi Shivakumar et al. Excipients in transdermal formulations have various functions. Solubilizers, such as propylene glycol or ethanol, can enhance drug solubility in the vehicle. Preservatives are often required to inhibit microbial growth, particularly in water-containing formulations. Antioxidants may be incorporated to protect drugs that are suscep- tible to oxidation. Viscosity modi\ufb01ers such as cellulose derivatives can optimize the rheological properties of a formulation, affecting its spreadability and retention on the skin [23]. Adhesives are critical components in transdermal patch formu- lations that ensure proper contact between the drug-containing matrix and skin. Common adhesives include acrylic polymers, sili- cone adhesives, and polyisobutylene. The selection of an adhesive depends on its compatibility with the drug and other formulation components, as well as its ability to maintain adhesion over the intended duration of use. 4.3 Permeation Enhancers Permeation enhancers temporarily and reversibly alter the structure of the stratum corneum, facilitating drug penetration through the skin. These compounds play a vital role in overcoming the natural barrier function of the skin and improving the bioavailability of transdermally delivered drugs. Permeation enhancers can act through various mechanisms, including disruption of the ordered structure of stratum corneum lipids, interactions with intercellular proteins, and increased drug partitioning into the skin [24]. Chemical permeation enhancers are widely used in transdermal formulations. Alcohols and polyols, such as ethanol and propylene glycol, can increase drug solubility and extract lipids from the stratum corneum, creating diffusion pathways. Fatty acids such as oleic acid can disrupt lipid pa", "y used in transdermal formulations. Alcohols and polyols, such as ethanol and propylene glycol, can increase drug solubility and extract lipids from the stratum corneum, creating diffusion pathways. Fatty acids such as oleic acid can disrupt lipid packing in the stratum corneum, thereby enhancing drug penetration. Surfactants, including sodium lauryl sulfate, can solubilize lipids and denature keratin, thereby facilitat- ing drug passage through the skin. Terpenes derived from natural sources have garnered attention as effective and relatively safe permeation enhancers. Compounds such as menthol and limonene can interact with intercellular lipids, increasing their \ufb02uidity and improving drug diffusion. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is a potent permeation enhancer that can dena- ture proteins and alter keratin conformation in the stratum cor- neum, although its use is limited owing to potential irritation. Recently, physical permeation enhancement techniques have been developed to complement or replace chemical enhancers. These include iontophoresis, which employs a small electric current to drive ionized drug molecules through the skin, and microneedle technology, which creates temporary microchannels in stratum corneum for drug delivery. These physical methods can provide more controlled and targeted drug delivery while minimizing skin irritation associated with some chemical enhancers.", "Transdermal Drug Delivery: Technology and Applications 193 Table 2 Therapeutic applications of transdermal drug delivery systems Therapeutic area Examples of drugs Bene\ufb01ts of transdermal delivery Cardiovascular Nitroglycerin, clonidine Controlled release, avoid \ufb01rst-pass metabolism Hormonal therapy Estradiol, testosterone Mimic physiological hormone levels Pain management Fentanyl, lidocaine Sustained pain relief, reduced systemic side effects Neurological disorders Rotigotine (Parkinson\u2019s), rivastigmine (Alzheimer\u2019s) Steady drug levels, improved adherence Smoking cessation Nicotine Controlled nicotine delivery, behavioral support Table 3 Comparison of transdermal drug delivery Technology Mechanism Advantages Limitations Passive patches Diffusion through skin Simple, non-invasive Limited to small, lipophilic drugs Iontophoresis Electric current drives charged drugs Enhances delivery of ionic drugs Requires power source, potential skin irritation Microneedles Create microchannels in skin Enables delivery of larger molecules Manufacturing complexity, potential skin reactions Nanocarriers Encapsulate drugs in nanoparticles Improves drug stability and penetration Complex formulation, potential toxicity concerns Sonophoresis Ultrasound enhances skin permeability Increases delivery of various molecules Requires specialized equipment, limited clinical data When incorporating permeation enhancers into transdermal formulations, it is crucial to balance their ef\ufb01cacy with potential skin irritation or long-term effects on skin barrier function (Table 2).

Transdermal delivery systems can be broadly categorized into passive, active, and nanocarrier-based sys- tems, each with distinct mechanisms and applications (Table 3).", "194 Pabbathi Shivakumar et al. 1. Passive systems, including patches, gels, and creams, rely on the natural permeability of the skin for drug delivery. Transdermal patches are adhesive systems that contain a drug reservoir that releases the medication at a controlled rate [25]. These patches have gained widespread acceptance and are used for various treatments such as nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation, hormone replacement therapy for menopausal symp- toms, and pain management with opioid analgesics. The con- trolled-release mechanism of the patches allows for sustained drug delivery over extended periods, enhancing patient com- pliance and reducing dosing frequency. Gels and creams are topical formulations that enable drugs to penetrate the skin through diffusion and are particularly useful for localized treat- ments such as topical analgesics or anti-in\ufb02ammatory agents. While passive systems are user-friendly and generally well tol- erated, they may have limitations regarding the size and type of molecules that can be effectively delivered, often restricted to small, lipophilic compounds. 2. Active systems employ external energy sources or physical methods to enhance drug penetration through the skin, thereby addressing some of the limitations of passive delivery. Iontophoresis utilizes a small electric current to drive charged drug molecules across the skin barrier, which is particularly useful for delivering water-soluble, charged medications, such as certain pain medications or anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs. Elec- troporation involves the application of high-voltage electrical pulses to create temporary pores in the skin, thereby allowing the passage of larger molecules. This method has demonstrated potential for the delivery of macromolecules, including p", "ec- troporation involves the application of high-voltage electrical pulses to create temporary pores in the skin, thereby allowing the passage of larger molecules. This method has demonstrated potential for the delivery of macromolecules, including pro- teins and nucleic acids, which are typically challenging to administer transdermally [26]. Sonophoresis uses ultrasound waves to increase skin permeability, enabling the delivery of both small and large molecules. Ultrasound energy temporarily disrupts the skin\u2019s structure, creating pathways for drug pene- tration. This technique has been explored for various applica- tions, including insulin and vaccine delivery [27]. Microneedles represent another innovative approach for active transdermal delivery systems. These minimally invasive devices con- sist of arrays of microscopic needles that create small channels in the skin for drug delivery. Microneedles can be solid and coated with drugs, dissolving types that release the drug as they dissolve in the skin, or hollow for direct drug administration. The small size of these needles (typically less than 1 mm in length) allows painless application while effectively bypassing the stratum corneum, which is the main barrier to transdermal drug delivery. Microneedle tech- nology has shown promise in vaccine delivery, insulin", "administration, and delivery of large molecules that are typically challenging to administer through the skin. Transdermal Drug Delivery: Technology and Applications 195 3. Nanocarrier-based systems represent an advanced approach to transdermal drug delivery that leverages the unique properties of nanoscale materials. These systems use nanoparticles, lipo- somes, dendrimers, and other nanostructures to encapsulate and transport drugs across the skin barrier. Nanocarriers offer several advantages in transdermal delivery, including protection of drugs from degradation, enhanced stability during storage and application, improved solubility of poorly water-soluble drugs, and enhanced penetration through skin layers, poten- tially improving drug bioavailability [28]. One of the key bene\ufb01ts of nanocarrier-based systems is their potential for targeted delivery and controlled release of medica- tions. By modifying the surface properties of nanocarriers, it is possible to direct them to speci\ufb01c skin layers or particular cell types within the skin, thereby enhancing their therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy while minimizing systemic side effects. Controlled release mechan- isms can be incorporated into nanocarrier designs, allowing for sustained drug delivery over extended periods, which is particularly bene\ufb01cial for drugs requiring consistent blood levels or for reduc- ing dosing frequency to improve patient compliance. The versatility of nanocarrier systems allows the delivery of a wide range of therapeutic agents, including small molecules, pro- teins, and nucleic acids. Lipid-based nanocarriers, such as liposomes and solid lipid nanoparticles, have shown promise in delivering both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs. Polymeric nanoparticles offer tunable release pro\ufb01les and can be designed to ", "eins, and nucleic acids. Lipid-based nanocarriers, such as liposomes and solid lipid nanoparticles, have shown promise in delivering both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs. Polymeric nanoparticles offer tunable release pro\ufb01les and can be designed to respond to speci\ufb01c stimuli, such as pH changes or temperature. Dendrimers, with their highly branched structures, provide a unique platform for drug encapsulation and controlled release. Each transdermal drug delivery technology offers unique advantages and faces speci\ufb01c challenges. Passive systems are gener- ally simpler and more cost-effective but may be limited in their ability to deliver larger or hydrophilic molecules. The development of new patch designs and formulation techniques continues to expand the range of drugs that can be delivered passively. Active systems can overcome many of the limitations of passive delivery but may require more complex devices and careful consideration of safety aspects. The integration of active delivery methods with smart technologies and wearable devices is an area of ongoing research that promises more precise and patient-friendly drug delivery. Nanocarrier-based systems offer great potential for enhancing drug delivery but require sophisticated formulation techniques and thorough evaluation of their long-term safety and ef\ufb01cacy. The", "behavior of nanoparticles in biological systems, including their potential toxicity and long-term accumulation, remains an area of active investigation. Regulatory considerations for nanomedicine products also present challenges for bringing these advanced deliv- ery systems to the market. 196 Pabbathi Shivakumar et al.

For instance, drugs with a narrow therapeutic window may bene\ufb01t from the controlled release offered by patches or nanocarrier systems. Vaccines or large-molecule drugs may be better suited for delivery via microneedles or advanced nanocarrier formulations. Patient factors such as skin condition, age, and lifestyle also play a role in selecting the most appropriate delivery system. 5 Evaluation Methods for Transdermal Drug Delivery Systems 1. In vitro permeation studies are essential for evaluating trans- dermal drug delivery systems (TDDS) before in vivo testing. These studies typically employed Franz diffusion cells or similar apparatus to assess drug permeation through excised human or animal skin or synthetic membranes [29]. The choice of mem- brane is critical because it can signi\ufb01cantly impact the results a", "se studies typically employed Franz diffusion cells or similar apparatus to assess drug permeation through excised human or animal skin or synthetic membranes [29]. The choice of mem- brane is critical because it can signi\ufb01cantly impact the results and their relevance to in vivo conditions. Excised human skin is considered the gold standard; however, its limited availability often necessitates the use of animal skin or synthetic alternatives. The donor compartment contains the TDDS or drug formula- tion, whereas the receptor compartment is \ufb01lled with a physiologi- cally relevant medium. The receptor medium was carefully selected to maintain sink conditions and to mimic the physiological envi- ronment. Factors such as pH, temperature, and stirring rate were tightly controlled to ensure reproducibility and physiological relevance.", "Transdermal Drug Delivery: Technology and Applications 197 Samples were collected from the receptor compartment at pre- determined intervals and analyzed using validated analytical meth- ods, such as HPLC or LC-MS/MS. The sampling frequency and duration were optimized to capture the drug\u2019s permeation pro\ufb01le accurately. These analytical techniques offer high sensitivity and speci\ufb01city, allowing for precise quanti\ufb01cation of drug concentra- tions, even at low levels. Key parameters derived from these studies include the steady- state \ufb02ux, lag time, and permeability coef\ufb01cient. Steady-state \ufb02ux represents the rate of drug permeation across a membrane under equilibrium conditions. Lag time indicates the time required for the drug to establish a concentration gradient across the mem- brane. The permeability coef\ufb01cient provides a measure of the mem- brane\u2019s resistance to drug permeation, accounting for both the drug\u2019s physicochemical properties and membrane characteristics. Advanced techniques such as confocal laser scanning micros- copy and ATR-FTIR spectroscopy can provide insights into drug distribution within skin layers and potential interactions with skin components. Confocal microscopy allows for three-dimensional visualization of \ufb02uorescently labeled drugs within the skin, reveal- ing their penetration pathways and accumulation in speci\ufb01c skin structures. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy enables noninvasive analysis of molecular interactions between the drug and skin components, offering valuable information on the behavior of the drug at the molecular level. Furthermore, these advanced techniques can be complemented by emerging technologies, such as Raman spectroscopy and multi- photon microscopy. Raman spectroscopy provides chemical- speci\ufb01c information on drug distribution and", "g at the molecular level. Furthermore, these advanced techniques can be complemented by emerging technologies, such as Raman spectroscopy and multi- photon microscopy. Raman spectroscopy provides chemical- speci\ufb01c information on drug distribution and potential structural changes in skin lipids or proteins. Multiphoton microscopy offers high-resolution, three-dimensional imaging of the skin structure and drug penetration with minimal photodamage, allowing for real-time monitoring of drug permeation in intact skin samples. 2. In vivo pharmacokinetic studies are crucial for assessing the performance of TDDS in living organisms. These studies typi- cally involve administering TDDS to animal models or human volunteers and collecting blood samples at speci\ufb01ed time points. The choice of animal model is critical, considering factors such as skin permeability, metabolic pathways, and physiological similarities to humans. In human studies, careful selection of subjects and adherence to ethical guidelines is paramount. Plasma drug concentrations were then determined using sensi- tive analytical techniques. The analytical methods employed must be validated for selectivity, accuracy, precision, and stability to ensure reliable quanti\ufb01cation of drug levels in complex biological", "matrices. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spec- trometry (LC-MS/MS) is often the method of choice owing to its high sensitivity and speci\ufb01city. 198 Pabbathi Shivakumar et al. The key pharmacokinetic parameters evaluated included maxi- mum plasma concentration (Cmax), time to reach Cmax (Tmax), area under the curve (AUC), and elimination half-life. These para- meters provide crucial information regarding the rate and extent of drug absorption, distribution, and elimination. Cmax and Tmax offer insights into peak drug exposure and the time required to achieve it, respectively. AUC serves as a measure of overall drug exposure, while the elimination half-life indicates the persistence of the drug in the body. Advanced approaches may incorporate microdialysis techni- ques to measure drug concentrations in the extracellular \ufb02uid of target tissues. This method allows for continuous, real-time moni- toring of drug levels in speci\ufb01c tissue compartments, providing a more detailed understanding of drug distribution and local phar- macokinetics. Microdialysis is particularly valuable for assessing drug concentrations at the site of action, which may not always correlate directly with plasma levels. Additionally, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with radiolabeled drugs can provide real-time, noninvasive insights into drug distribution and kinetics across various organs and tis- sues. PET imaging offers unique advantages for visualizing drug biodistribution, penetration into target tissues, and potential off-target accumulation. This technique can be combined with other imaging modalities, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to provide an anatomical con- text and enhance data interpretation. Population pharmacokinetic modelin", "t accumulation. This technique can be combined with other imaging modalities, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to provide an anatomical con- text and enhance data interpretation. Population pharmacokinetic modeling and physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling are increasingly employed to analyze and interpret in vivo pharmacokinetic data. These noninvasive approaches can account for inter-individual variability, predict drug behavior in different patient populations, and facilitate the optimization of dosing regimens. They also play a crucial role in extrapolating data from animal studies to humans and in predicting drug-drug interactions. 3. Safety and irritation assessments are critical for ensuring the biocompatibility and tolerability of TDDS. In vitro methods include cytotoxicity assays using relevant cell lines and 3D-reconstructed human skin models to evaluate potential skin irritation and corrosion. These models, such as EpiSkin and EpiDerm, mimic the structure and function of human skin and provide a more physiologically relevant platform for asses- sing the effects of TDDS components on skin viability and barrier function [30].", "Transdermal Drug Delivery: Technology and Applications 199 Cytotoxicity assays typically employ multiple endpoints, including cell viability, membrane integrity, and metabolic activity, to comprehensively evaluate the potential toxic effects of TDDS components. Advanced in vitro methods may also incorporate in\ufb02ammatory markers and cytokine pro\ufb01ling to assess the potential for skin sensitization and irritation at the molecular level. Ex vivo studies on excised human skin can assess changes in skin barrier function and the potential for irritation. These studies often employed techniques such as transepidermal water loss (TEWL) measurement, electrical impedance spectroscopy, and laser Doppler \ufb02owmetry to evaluate skin barrier integrity, hydration, and micro- circulation, respectively [31]. Histological and immunohistochem- ical analyses of skin samples can provide detailed information on the structural changes and in\ufb02ammatory responses induced by TDDS application. In vivo studies of transdermal drug delivery systems (TDDS) encompass a comprehensive range of tests designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of these formulations in living organisms. Patch testing, a cornerstone of these studies, involves applying the TDDS to the skin of animals and humans under controlled condi- tions. This method allows researchers to observe and quantify any local reactions, such as erythema, edema, or other signs of irrita- tion. The standardization of these protocols, particularly through the OECD Test Guidelines, ensures that the results are reproduc- ible and comparable across different laboratories and regulatory jurisdictions. Acute irritation tests typically involve short-term exposure to TDDS, whereas cumulative irritation studies assess the effects of repeated applications ", "lts are reproduc- ible and comparable across different laboratories and regulatory jurisdictions. Acute irritation tests typically involve short-term exposure to TDDS, whereas cumulative irritation studies assess the effects of repeated applications over an extended period, mim- icking real-world usage patterns. Sensitization studies, such as the local lymph node assay (LLNA) in animals or the human repeated insult patch test (HRIPT), assess the potential of TDDS compo- nents to induce allergic contact dermatitis. Sensitization studies have delved deeper into the immunologi- cal aspects of TDDS safety. The local lymph node assay (LLNA) in animals provides a quantitative measure of the potential of a sub- stance to induce an allergic response by examining lymphocyte proliferation in draining lymph nodes [32]. In humans, the repeated insult patch test (HRIPT) involves repeated applications of TDDS over several weeks, followed by a challenge phase to detect any delayed hypersensitivity reactions [33]. These compre- hensive in vivo studies are essential for predicting the safety pro\ufb01le of TDDS in clinical use and for meeting regulatory requirements for market approval. Advanced techniques, such as re\ufb02ectance confocal microscopy and optical coherence tomography, allow noninvasive, real-time visualization of skin responses to TDDS application. These imaging modalities provide high-resolution in vivo visualization of the skin structure and can detect subtle changes in skin morphology,", "microvascular alterations, and in\ufb02ammatory responses. They offer the advantage of longitudinal monitoring without the need for invasive biopsies. 200 Pabbathi Shivakumar et al. Systemic toxicity assessments may include repeated-dose stud- ies in animals, with a focus on organs involved in drug metabolism and elimination. These studies evaluated potential off-target effects, drug accumulation in tissues, and changes in organ function over time. Toxicokinetic analyses are often incorporated to corre- late systemic exposure with observed toxicological effects. Long-term safety studies are essential for TDDS intended for chronic use to evaluate the potential cumulative effects and changes in skin physiology over extended periods. These studies assessed the impact of prolonged TDDS application on skin barrier function, dermal microbiome, and local immune responses. They also moni- tor for potential systemic effects, such as alterations in endocrine function or the development of tolerance. Furthermore, post-marketing surveillance and pharmacovigi- lance programs play a crucial role in identifying rare adverse events and long-term safety concerns that may not be apparent in preclini- cal and clinical studies. These programs involve systematic collec- tion and analysis of real-world data on TDDS use, providing valuable insights into the safety pro\ufb01les of these products in diverse patient populations and under various conditions of use. 6 Applications of Transdermal Drug Delivery Transdermal drug delivery systems (TDDS) have signi\ufb01cantly advanced the administration of medications across various thera- peutic areas, offering substantial advantages over traditional oral and injectable routes. 6.1 Therapeutic Areas Cardiovascular diseases represent a prominent area where TDDS have", "antly advanced the administration of medications across various thera- peutic areas, offering substantial advantages over traditional oral and injectable routes. 6.1 Therapeutic Areas Cardiovascular diseases represent a prominent area where TDDS have made notable contributions. Nitroglycerin patches are essen- tial components in the management of angina pectoris. These patches provide a controlled release of nitroglycerin, maintain ther- apeutic plasma concentrations, and reduce the frequency of anginal episodes. The sustained delivery of nitroglycerin through TDDS helps mitigate the rapid development of tolerance often observed with oral formulations, ensuring consistent ef\ufb01cacy throughout the treatment period. Another signi\ufb01cant example is the clonidine patch, which is utilized in the treatment of hypertension. This system facilitates the steady delivery of clonidine over several days, enhancing patient compliance and minimizing the side effects associated with oral administration. Transdermal delivery of clonidine helps maintain stable plasma concentrations, reducing the risk of rebound hyper- tension that can occur with sudden discontinuation of oral therapy.", "More recently, the transdermal delivery of beta-blockers, such as metoprolol, has demonstrated promise in maintaining consistent plasma levels and reducing dosing frequency in hypertension man- agement. These patches offer the potential for improved adherence and enhanced blood pressure control, particularly in patients who experience dif\ufb01culties with multiple daily oral medications. Transdermal Drug Delivery: Technology and Applications 201 Hormonal therapies have signi\ufb01cantly bene\ufb01ted from TDDS, particularly contraception and hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Transdermal contraceptive patches containing ethinyl estradiol and norelgestromin offer convenient weekly application, improving compliance compared to daily oral contraceptives. These patches provide a steady release of hormones, maintain consistent blood levels, and potentially reduce the side effects associated with daily hormonal \ufb02uctuations observed with oral contraceptives. In HRT, estradiol patches have gained increasing popularity for the management of menopausal symptoms. These patches provide more physiological delivery of estrogen, bypassing \ufb01rst-pass metab- olism and reducing the risk of thromboembolism associated with oral estrogen. The transdermal route allows lower doses of estrogen to be used effectively, potentially enhancing the overall safety pro- \ufb01le of HRT. Testosterone patches have also been developed for treating hypogonadism in men, offering a controlled release that mimics the body\u2019s natural diurnal rhythm of testosterone produc- tion. This approach helps maintain physiological testosterone levels throughout the day, potentially improving symptoms such as libido, energy levels, and muscle mass more effectively than other formulations. Pain management is another area where TDDS has made s", "pproach helps maintain physiological testosterone levels throughout the day, potentially improving symptoms such as libido, energy levels, and muscle mass more effectively than other formulations. Pain management is another area where TDDS has made sig- ni\ufb01cant advancements. Fentanyl patches have revolutionized the treatment of chronic pain, particularly in patients with cancer. These patches provide continuous pain relief for up to 72 h, reduc- ing the need for frequent dosing and minimizing the risk of opioid- induced side effects. The steady release of fentanyl helps prevent peaks and troughs in plasma concentrations associated with oral opioids, potentially reducing the risk of breakthrough pain and improving overall pain control. Lidocaine patches have demonstrated ef\ufb01cacy in managing localized neuropathic pain conditions, such as postherpetic neural- gia. Topical application allows for high local concentrations of lidocaine with minimal systemic absorption, reducing the risk of systemic side effects. This targeted approach to pain management is particularly bene\ufb01cial for patients who may be sensitive to systemic analgesics or those with comorbidities that limit the use of oral medications. More recently, TDDS incorporating NSAIDs, such as diclofenac, have shown promise in managing osteoarthritis pain, offering localized pain relief with reduced gastrointestinal side effects compared to oral administration. These patches allow for", "sustained delivery of NSAID directly to the affected joint, poten- tially improving ef\ufb01cacy while minimizing systemic exposure. 202 Pabbathi Shivakumar et al. In the realm of neurological disorders, TDDS has opened new avenues for treatment. The rotigotine patch has become an impor- tant option in the management of Parkinson\u2019s, providing continu- ous dopaminergic stimulation and potentially reducing motor \ufb02uctuations. This steady delivery of medication helps mimic the continuous stimulation of dopamine receptors that occurs naturally in the brain, potentially leading to more stable symptom control throughout the day. For Alzheimer\u2019s disease, rivastigmine patches offer an alterna- tive to oral cholinesterase inhibitors, with the potential for improved tolerability and adherence. Transdermal delivery of rivas- tigmine allows for a more gradual increase in plasma concentra- tions, potentially reducing the gastrointestinal side effects commonly associated with oral formulations and improving overall treatment adherence. In the \ufb01eld of attention-de\ufb01cit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), methylphenidate patches have been developed, which provide con- trolled release of medication throughout the day and potentially reduce the stigma associated with taking medication at school. These patches offer the advantage of maintaining consistent medi- cation levels throughout the school days, potentially improving symptom control and academic performance. Transdermal delivery systems are also being explored for the management of epilepsy, with investigational patches containing anticonvulsants, such as carbamazepine, showing promise in pre- clinical studies.

The potential for steady-state plasma concentra- tions of anticonvulsants through TDDS could lead to improved seizure control and reduced side effects compared to oral formulations. The application of TDDS across these therapeutic areas demonstrates the versatility and potential of this drug delivery approach. As research progresses, it is anticipated that further inno- vations in transdermal technology will emerge, expanding its appli- cations to a broader range of diseases and improving patient outcomes. Future developments may include the incorporation of smart technologies into TDDS, enabling the real-time monitoring of drug delivery and patient response. Additionally, advances in nanotechnology and microneedle systems may further enhance the range of drugs that can be delivered transdermally, potentially including larger molecules such as proteins and peptides. The continued evolution of TDDS holds promise for improving medi- cation adherence, reducing side effects, and ultimately enhancing the quality of life of patients across various therapeutic domains.", "Transdermal Drug Delivery: Technology and Applications 203 6.2 Case Studies of Successful Transdermal Products Case studies of successful transdermal products provide valuable insights into the development, formulation, and commercialization of these drug delivery systems. Notable examples include the nitro- glycerin patch for angina, which signi\ufb01cantly improves the manage- ment of this cardiovascular condition by providing sustained medication release over an extended period. The scopolamine patch for motion sickness demonstrated the ef\ufb01cacy of transdermal delivery in addressing acute symptoms while minimizing systemic side effects. The fentanyl patch for chronic pain management illus- trates the capacity of transdermal systems to deliver potent analge- sics in a controlled manner, thereby enhancing patient compliance and quality of life. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of transdermal delivery in providing controlled and sustained drug release while circumventing \ufb01rst-pass metabolism. By bypassing the gastrointes- tinal tract and liver, transdermal delivery systems can enhance bio- availability and reduce dosing frequency, leading to improved therapeutic outcomes and patient adherence. The nicotine patch, which is widely utilized for smoking cessation, exempli\ufb01es the potential of transdermal systems in addressing public health chal- lenges. This product has been instrumental in assisting millions of individuals to quit smoking by providing a steady release of nicotine to manage withdrawal symptoms.

Hormone replacement therapy patches, such as those contain- ing estradiol, highlight the versatility of transdermal delivery in various therapeutic areas. These patches have become a preferred option for many patients because of their ability to maintain stable hormone levels and mitigate the side effects associated with oral hormone therapy. The development of these patches has necessi- tated careful consideration of factors such as skin permeation, adhesion properties, and drug stability. These case studies illustrate the importance of optimizing the physicochemical properties of drugs, selecting appropriate adhe- sives and backing materials, and overcoming skin permeation bar- riers to achieve successful transdermal drug delivery. Researchers and formulators must carefully consider factors such as molecular weight, lipophilicity, and ionization state of the drug molecule to ensure ef\ufb01cient skin penetration. The selection of suitable adhesives and backing materials is crucial for maintaining product integrity, ensuring consistent drug release, and promoting patient comfort and acceptance.", "204 Pabbathi Shivakumar et al. 7 Regulatory Considerations and Approval Process 7.1 FDA Guidelines for Transdermal Drug Delivery Systems The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has established comprehensive guidelines for the development, manufacturing, and approval of transdermal drug delivery systems (TDDS). These guidelines aim to ensure the safety, ef\ufb01cacy, and quality of TDDS. The FDA\u2019s regulatory approach for TDDS is delineated in various guidance documents, including the \u201cGuidance for Indus- try: Residual Drug in Transdermal and Related Drug Delivery Systems\u201d and \u201cGuidance for Industry: Transdermal and Topical Delivery Systems\u2014Product Development and Quality Considerations.\u201d Key aspects of the FDA guidelines for TDDS encompass the requirements for product characterization, in vitro release testing, adhesion performance, skin irritation and sensitization studies, and pharmacokinetic evaluations. The FDA emphasizes the importance of considering the impact of heat, physical activity, and other envi- ronmental factors on drug delivery and absorption. Manufacturers are required to demonstrate that their TDDS products maintain consistent drug delivery rates throughout their intended duration of use under various conditions. 7.2 Quality Control and Manufacturing Standards Quality control and manufacturing standards for TDDS are essen- tial for ensuring product safety, ef\ufb01cacy, and consistency. The FDA mandates that manufacturers adhere to Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), as outlined in 21 CFR Part 211. These standards encompass all aspects of production, from raw material sourcing to \ufb01nal product packaging and labeling. Speci\ufb01c quality control measures for TDDS include rigorous testing of drug substance purity, uniformity of drug distribution within the sy", "andards encompass all aspects of production, from raw material sourcing to \ufb01nal product packaging and labeling. Speci\ufb01c quality control measures for TDDS include rigorous testing of drug substance purity, uniformity of drug distribution within the system, and stability of the formulation over time. Manufacturers are required to implement robust analytical meth- ods to assess critical quality attributes, such as drug release kinetics, adhesive properties, and moisture content. In-process controls are essential for monitoring and maintaining consistency throughout the manufacturing process. Furthermore, manufacturers must establish and validate clean- ing procedures for the equipment used in TDDS production to prevent cross-contamination. Environmental monitoring in clean- room facilities is crucial for maintaining the required level of clean- liness and sterility. Stability testing programs were implemented to ensure that TDDS products maintained their quality throughout their shelf life under speci\ufb01ed storage conditions. 7.3 Clinical Trial Requirements Clinical trials for TDDS follow a similar pathway to other drug products, but with speci\ufb01c considerations. The FDA typically requires a comprehensive clinical development program that", "includes Phase I, II, and III studies. These trials aim to establish the safety, ef\ufb01cacy, and optimal dosing regimen of TDDS. Transdermal Drug Delivery: Technology and Applications 205 Phase I studies focused on initial safety assessments and phar- macokinetic pro\ufb01ling. These trials often include dermal safety stud- ies to evaluate skin irritation and sensitization potential. Adhesion performance was also assessed during early clinical development. Phase II trials involve larger patient populations and aim to establish proof-of-concept, dose-ranging, and preliminary ef\ufb01cacy data. For TDDS, these studies often include evaluations of different patch sizes or wearing durations to optimize drug delivery. Phase III trials are large-scale studies designed to con\ufb01rm ef\ufb01cacy and safety in the target patient population. For TDDS, these trials must demonstrate that the product delivers the drug effectively and consistently under real-world conditions. Long- term safety data, including the effects of repeated applications to the same skin site, are typically required. Throughout the clinical development process, sponsors must address speci\ufb01c challenges related to TDDS, such as the potential variability in drug absorption due to differences in skin permeability among individuals and at different body sites. The FDA may also require speci\ufb01c studies to assess the impact of external factors, such as heat, exercise, or bathing, on drug delivery and absorption (Table 5). Post-approval studies may be necessary to further evaluate long-term safety and ef\ufb01cacy or to address speci\ufb01c safety concerns identi\ufb01ed during the pre-approval process.

Researchers are currently exploring various strategies to address this challenge. One promising approach involves the utilization of chemical penetration enhancers, such as terpenes, fatty acids, and surfactants, which temporarily disrupt the structure of the stratum corneum. For example, menthol has demonstrated signi\ufb01cant enhancement in the permeation of ibuprofen through the human skin. Another innovative method is the application of microneedles, which create temporary microchannels in the skin that facilitate enhanced drug penetration. Dissolving microneedles loaded with insulin have been shown to improve glycemic control in diabetic rats. Physical meth- ods such as iontophoresis and sonophoresis are also being re\ufb01ned to increase drug permeation using electrical current and ultrasound, respectively. 8.2 Expanding the Range of Deliverable Drugs Traditionally, transdermal delivery has been limited to small lipo- philic molecules. However, recent advancements have aimed to expand this range to include larger molecules and hydrophilic compounds. Nanocarrier systems, including liposomes, niosomes, and transfersomes, have been developed to encapsulate and deliver a wide variety of drugs. For instance, transfersomes have success- fully delivered insulin transdermally in diabetic rats, achieving glu- cose reduction comparable to subcutaneous injections. Another approach involves the use of prodrugs, in which the active com- pound is chemically modi\ufb01ed to enhance its skin permeation p", "elivered insulin transdermally in diabetic rats, achieving glu- cose reduction comparable to subcutaneous injections. Another approach involves the use of prodrugs, in which the active com- pound is chemically modi\ufb01ed to enhance its skin permeation prop- erties and subsequently converted back to the active form once inside the body. This strategy has been successfully employed for the transdermal delivery of acyclovir, signi\ufb01cantly improving its bioavailability compared to oral administration. 8.3 Intelligent and Responsive Transdermal Systems Development of smart transdermal systems capable of responding to external stimuli or physiological changes is an exciting frontier in drug delivery research. These systems aim to provide precise con- trol over drug release, thereby improving ef\ufb01cacy and reducing side effects. One example is the glucose-responsive insulin delivery system that releases insulin in response to elevated blood glucose levels. These systems typically use glucose oxidase enzymes or phenylboronic acid derivatives as glucose-sensing elements. Another innovative approach involves the use of thermoresponsive polymers in transdermal patches. These materials can alter their properties in response to temperature variations, allowing con- trolled drug release. For instance, a poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-", "based hydrogel patch has shown promise for the on-demand deliv- ery of lidocaine, with the release triggered by slight temperature increases. Transdermal Drug Delivery: Technology and Applications 207 8.4 Integration with Other Drug Delivery Technologies The future of transdermal drug delivery lies in its integration with other advanced technologies to create more effective and versatile systems. One such integration involves microelectronics to develop \u201csmart\u201d patches capable of monitoring physiological parameters and adjusting drug delivery accordingly. For example, a closed- loop system combining continuous glucose monitoring with an insulin-delivering patch pump has demonstrated potential for man- aging diabetes. Another promising area is the combination of transdermal delivery and gene therapy. Microneedle arrays have been utilized to deliver plasmid DNA and siRNA for localized gene expression or silencing, opening new possibilities for treating skin disorders and cancers. In addition, the integration of transder- mal systems with 3D printing technology is gaining attention, enabling the fabrication of personalized patches. 8.5 Conclusion Transdermal drug delivery systems have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional drug administration methods, offering numerous advantages, such as enhanced patient compliance, con- trolled medication release, and minimized side effects. This chapter examines the diverse technologies and applications of transdermal drug delivery, emphasizing its potential to revolutionize healthcare and improve patient outcomes.

Advancements in transdermal drug delivery technologies, including microneedles, iontophoresis, and nanocarrier-based systems, have signi\ufb01cantly expanded the range of drugs that can be transdermally administered. These innovations have overcome many limitations associated with conventional transdermal patches, such as poor skin permeability and restricted drug molecular weight constraints. The potential impact of transdermal drug delivery on health- care and patient outcomes is substantial. By providing a noninva- sive, pain-free method of drug administration, these systems can signi\ufb01cantly enhance patient compliance, particularly for chronic conditions requiring long-term medication. Controlled and sus- tained release of drugs through the skin can lead to more stable plasma concentrations, reduce dosing frequency, and minimize side effects associated with peak-and-trough plasma levels. Further- more, transdermal delivery circumvents \ufb01rst-pass metabolism and potentially increases the bioavailability and ef\ufb01cacy of drugs. Future research directions in transdermal drug delivery should focus on addressing the remaining challenges and expanding its applications. This includes developing more advanced smart deliv- ery systems that can respond to physiological changes or external stimuli, improving the delivery of large-molecular-weight drugs and biologics, and enhancing the long-term stability of transdermal", "formulations. Additionally, research efforts should aim to optimize the integration of transdermal systems with wearable technologies and telemedicine platforms to enable real-time monitoring and personalized drug delivery. 208 Pabbathi Shivakumar et al. In conclusion, transdermal drug delivery represents a signi\ufb01- cant advancement in pharmaceutical science and healthcare.

Despite advancements in radiation, chemotherapy, and surgical treatments, limitations such as poor drug speci\ufb01city, toxicity, and resistance hinder their effectiveness. Emerging strategies, including the development of smart drug delivery systems (SDDS) and tumor-homing peptides, offer a promising alternative by enhancing drug ef\ufb01cacy while minimizing side effects. Tumor-homing peptides, through selective targeting and internalization, enable precise delivery of therapeutic agents to tumor cells, improving therapeutic outcomes. Nanotechnology has further revolutionized drug delivery systems, providing stimuli-responsive platforms for enhanced targeting. Additionally, the tumor microenvironment (TME) has been recognized as a crucial factor in\ufb02uencing cancer progression and therapy response. This chapter highlights the role of peptides in addressing key challenges in cancer therapy, including targeting tumor vasculature, extracellular matrix, lymphatic vessels, and cell membranes, while also presenting innovative strategies for drug delivery and therapeutic intervention.

These \ufb01gures underscore the urgent need for ongoing research and advancements in cancer treatment. Currently, the most widely used cancer treatment mod- alities are radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery. However, given the prevalence of highly aggressive tumors with a high death rate, these approaches have clear limitations leading to unfavorable out- comes and high relapse rates. Enhancing current cancer treatments primarily faces the dif\ufb01culty of selectively delivering medications to tumor cells with precision. Drugs used to treat cancers are fre- quently hampered by poor speci\ufb01city and related toxicity issues.

Thus, targeted drug delivery to cancer cells remains a major limitation in enhancing current cancer therapies. 212 Sonal Saxena et al. Enhancing drug ef\ufb01cacy while decreasing side effects can be achieved through the selective targeting of agents such as chemo- therapeutic drugs, radiotherapeutic drugs, or oncolytic viruses to tumors. Smart drug delivery systems have the potential to target speci\ufb01city, give controlled release, and be able to penetrate biological barriers, all of which can lead to improved therapeutic effects with reduced systemic adverse effects. Anticancer medica- tions can be made more selectively lethal by encasing them in delivery systems and delivering them to cancer cells using homing peptide ligands or monoclonal antibodies that attach to antigens or receptors that are either overexpressed or speci\ufb01cally expressed on cancer cells. Clinical potential for monoclonal antibodies as tumor- targeting therapies has been demonstrated. However, there are important drawbacks to antibody-mediated cancer therapy, includ- ing limited tumor penetration due to their size and damage to the liver or bone marrow due to nonspeci\ufb01c absorption. Peptides offer several advantages over antibodies as targeting moieties, such as better organ penetration and a reduced likelihood of unintended immune reactions. Consequently, peptide-targeting agents have been proposed to address the problems associated with antibody cancer therapy. Phage-displayed peptide libraries have been utilized to identify peptides that target speci\ufb01c organs, tumors, or proteins. Research indicates that combining a tumor-homing peptide w", "sed to address the problems associated with antibody cancer therapy. Phage-displayed peptide libraries have been utilized to identify peptides that target speci\ufb01c organs, tumors, or proteins. Research indicates that combining a tumor-homing peptide with a cell-penetrating peptide can create a chimeric peptide with tumor cell speci\ufb01city capable of delivering cargo molecules into the cells. Tumor-homing peptides are thus crucial tools for the selective targeting, imaging, and destruction of tumor cells. In recent years, nanotechnology has also revolutionized the \ufb01eld of drug delivery systems, especially in chemotherapy, by introducing smart drug delivery systems (SDDS) that utilize nanoparticles. These systems offer signi\ufb01cant advantages over traditional drug delivery methods, particularly in reducing side effects. Biomedical nano- technology has advanced dramatically over the past few decades, transforming conventional drug delivery systems (DDS) into sophisticated smart DDS with stimuli-responsive characteristics. These innovative nanoplatforms leverage speci\ufb01c internal or exter- nal triggers to enhance drug-targeting ef\ufb01cacy and minimize side effects or toxicities, which are crucial for improving patient compliance.", "Drug Delivery to Cancer: Targeting the Tumor Microenvironment 213 2 Importance of the Tumor Microenvironment (TME) in Cancer Progression and Therapy The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a pivotal role in cancer biology, in\ufb02uencing tumor progression, therapeutic response, and clinical outcomes. Composed of a diverse array of cell types and extracellular components, the TME creates a dynamic niche that supports tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. Understanding its complexity has led to the development of targeted therapies aimed at disrupting these supportive interactions. 2.1 Components of the TME The TME comprises of the following components: \u2022 Immune Cells: Including T cells, B cells, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), dendritic cells (DCs), natural killer (NK) cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and neutrophils. \u2022 Stromal Cells: Such as cancer-associated \ufb01broblasts (CAFs), peri- cytes, and mesenchymal stromal cells. \u2022 Extracellular Matrix (ECM): Provides structural support and signaling cues, composed of proteins like collagens, proteogly- cans, and glycoproteins. \u2022 Vascular Networks: Blood and lymphatic vessels crucial for nutri- ent supply, oxygenation, and immune cell traf\ufb01cking within tumors. 2.2 Therapeutic Targeting of the TME 1. Immune Cells in the TME \u2022 TAMs: TAMs can promote tumor progression through immunosuppressive cytokine secretion. Therapeutic strate- gies aim to polarize TAMs toward an anti-tumor phenotype or deplete them. \u2022 T Cells: Efforts focus on enhancing cytotoxic T cell responses (CD8+ T cells) against tumor cells through immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., anti-PD-1/PD-L1). \u2022 DCs: Dendritic cells are critical for antigen presentation and initiating adaptive immune responses against tumors. Stra- tegies involve enhancing DC ", " (CD8+ T cells) against tumor cells through immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., anti-PD-1/PD-L1). \u2022 DCs: Dendritic cells are critical for antigen presentation and initiating adaptive immune responses against tumors. Stra- tegies involve enhancing DC function to stimulate anti- tumor immunity. 2. Tumor Vasculature \u2022 Targeting angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels) is crucial to cut off nutrient supply to tumors. Anti-angiogenic therapies (e.g., VEGF inhibitors) disrupt tumor vasculature to starve tumors of oxygen and nutrients.", "214 Sonal Saxena et al. 3. Extracellular Matrix (ECM) \u2022 The ECM provides a physical scaffold and regulates signal- ing pathways that promote tumor growth and invasion. Therapeutic strategies involve ECM-targeting agents to inhibit tumor progression and metastasis. 4. Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) \u2022 CAFs contribute to tumor growth and resistance to thera- pies. Targeting CAFs aims to disrupt their pro-tumorigenic signaling and reduce ECM remodeling. 2.3 Impact of Standard Therapies on the TME \u2022 Chemotherapy: Can induce DNA damage in stromal cells, acti- vate survival pathways, and promote immunosuppressive cell types like TAMs. \u2022 Radiotherapy: Alters the TME by affecting tumor vasculature, inducing hypoxia, and promoting \ufb01brotic responses from CAFs. 3 Tumor-Homing Peptides Tumor-homing peptides are peptides that selectively bind to spe- ci\ufb01c receptors or overexpressed markers on tumor cells. They play a crucial role in targeted therapy and imaging by delivering drugs or imaging agents directly to tumor cells. These peptides can be categorized based on their ability to target and interact with tumor cells: 1. Peptides Targeting Speci\ufb01c Sites on Tumor Cells \u2022 These peptides selectively bind to molecules or receptors on the surface of tumor cells. They are designed to recognize and home to a particular location on the cell surface but do not enter into the cells themselves. This category of peptides is useful for targeting therapies where surface binding is suf\ufb01cient to deliver therapeutic agents or imaging agents. 2. Peptides Capable of Targeting and Internalization \u2022 Peptides in this category not only target speci\ufb01c receptors on tumor cells but also possess the ability to internalize into the cells after binding. Internalization allows these peptides to deliver pay", "tides Capable of Targeting and Internalization \u2022 Peptides in this category not only target speci\ufb01c receptors on tumor cells but also possess the ability to internalize into the cells after binding. Internalization allows these peptides to deliver payloads such as drugs directly into the tumor cells. This characteristic is particularly valuable for targeted drug delivery and imaging purposes. 3. Peptides Capable of Targeting, Internalization, and Cell Destruction \u2022 These peptides exhibit all the properties of the second cate- gory but go further by inducing cell death or apoptosis within the targeted tumor cells. They may carry cytotoxic", "Drug Delivery to Cancer: Targeting the Tumor Microenvironment 215 payloads or possess inherent cytotoxic properties them- selves. This capability makes them potent candidates for therapeutic peptides aimed at eliminating cancer cells selectively. 3.1 Different Strategies for Targeting Peptides to Tumor Microenvironment Cancer is characterized by genetic and epigenetic changes that enable cells to proliferate uncontrollably, evade apoptosis, sustain angiogenesis, and invade surrounding tissues. Targeted peptides have emerged as promising tools to disrupt these tumor-speci\ufb01c processes through various strategies: 1. Targeting Unique Receptors on Tumor Cells: Tumor cells often overexpress speci\ufb01c receptors that distinguish them from nor- mal cells, offering potential targets for selective peptide-based therapies. Examples include HER2 in breast cancer, GnRH in ovarian carcinomas, CXCR4 in multiple malignancies, and somatostatin receptors in neuroendocrine tumors. Peptide ligands for these receptors can serve as carriers for cytotoxic drugs or radiopharmaceuticals. Notably, octreotide, targeting somatostatin receptor subtype 2, is used clinically for radio- peptide therapy. CXCR4 DV3 ligand, linked to anticancer peptides, enhances tumor cell killing in CXCR4-expressing cancers, demonstrating targeted therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy. Similarly, FROP-1 targets various tumor cells, showing stable accumula- tion in vivo, particularly in thyroid and mammary carcinomas. Peptides like SP94 and SP94-conjugated liposomal doxorubi- cin target PSMA and enhance therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy against hepa- tocellular carcinoma. 2. Targeting Cell Death Regulators Cancer cells often evade apoptosis by upregulating antia- poptotic proteins like Bcl-2. Peptides derived from proapopto- tic proteins, such as Bad and", " enhance therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy against hepa- tocellular carcinoma. 2. Targeting Cell Death Regulators Cancer cells often evade apoptosis by upregulating antia- poptotic proteins like Bcl-2. Peptides derived from proapopto- tic proteins, such as Bad and BH3 domain peptides, have shown promise in inducing apoptosis in various cancer cell lines. Strategies targeting p53, through peptides like 37AA, restore apoptotic pathways, offering potential therapeutic avenues. 3. Targeting Tumor Blood Vessels/Antiangiogenesis Strategies Tumor angiogenesis, crucial for tumor growth, involves speci\ufb01c markers on tumor vasculature like \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin. Pep- tides such as RGD motif bind selectively to these integrins, inhibiting angiogenesis and offering avenues for targeted drug delivery and imaging. Other peptides like NGR motif target vasculature in multiple tumors without binding to corresponding normal tissues. SP5-52 peptide, another angiogenesis-targeting peptide, linked to liposomal doxorubi- cin, enhances therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy against lung and oral cancers, demonstrating potential clinical applications.", "216 Sonal Saxena et al. 4. Targeting Tumor Lymphatic Vessels Lymphatic vessels play a role in tumor metastasis, making them potential targets for therapy. Peptides like LyP-1 bind speci\ufb01cally to tumor lymphatics, offering avenues for develop- ing agents that can destroy tumor lymphatics and inhibit metastasis. LyP-1 also exhibits cytotoxic effects on tumor cells, further enhancing its therapeutic potential. 5. Targeting Extracellular Matrix and Cell-Matrix Interactions The extracellular matrix (ECM) and its interactions with cells are critical for tumor invasion and metastasis. Peptides like RGD motif, targeting integrins involved in ECM interactions, induce apoptosis and inhibit tumor growth and angiogenesis. Peptides derived from proteins like laminin (YIGSR) also show promise in decreasing tumor metastasis and growth. 6. Targeting Cell Membranes: Peptides with Necrotic Activity Necrosis-inducing peptides selectively target cancer cell membranes due to their negative charge and induce necrotic cell death. Examples include peptides from frog skin glands (melittin and defensins) and mammalian cecropins, which exhibit broad cytotoxic activity against various cancers, includ- ing resistant phenotypes. These strategies highlight the diverse roles of peptides in tar- geting speci\ufb01c aspects of tumor biology, from receptors and cell death pathways to angiogenesis and metastasis. Peptide-based therapies hold signi\ufb01cant promise in advancing cancer treatment by offering targeted approaches with reduced off-target effects compared to traditional therapies. 3.2 Applications and Development \u2022 Targeted Therapies: Tumor homing peptides are crucial for tar- geted therapies where drugs are speci\ufb01cally delivered to tumor cells, minimizing damage to healthy tissues. \u2022 Imaging Agents: Pep", "traditional therapies. 3.2 Applications and Development \u2022 Targeted Therapies: Tumor homing peptides are crucial for tar- geted therapies where drugs are speci\ufb01cally delivered to tumor cells, minimizing damage to healthy tissues. \u2022 Imaging Agents: Peptides that can internalize into tumor cells are also used as imaging agents, allowing for the visualization and monitoring of tumors in diagnostic procedures. \u2022 Advantages Over Traditional Therapies: Peptide-based therapies offer advantages such as higher speci\ufb01city, reduced side effects, and potentially overcoming resistance mechanisms observed with conventional chemotherapy. 3.3 Examples and Discoveries \u2022 Biopanning with Phage Display Libraries: This technique has led to the discovery of numerous tumor-homing peptides that rec- ognize speci\ufb01c markers on various types of cancer cells. \u2022 Clinical Applications: Peptides like LyP-1, targeting tumor lym- phatics, and RGD motif peptides, targeting angiogenic blood vessels, have shown promising results in preclinical and clinical studies.", "Drug Delivery to Cancer: Targeting the Tumor Microenvironment 217 4 Tumor Microenvironment Responsive Drug Delivery Systems (DDSS) Tumor microenvironment-responsive drug delivery systems (DDSs) are considered \u201csmart\u201d formulations capable of releasing drugs on-demand in response to stimuli from the tumor cellular environment, making them highly sought-after in nanomedicine. These systems achieve responsiveness by dynamically altering their physicochemical properties, such as size, surface charge, or expo- sure of ligands [12]. There are many obstacles facing traditional aiming techniques, such as passive and active targeting. The increased permeability and retention (EPR) effect, which is neces- sary for tumor accumulation when using passive targeting, requires nanocarriers more than 100 nm in size. However, for optimal tumor penetration, nanocarriers around 30 nm are preferred, cre- ating a size disparity. Active targeting employs ligands that bind to overexpressed receptors on cancer cells [1], but these ligands may interact non-speci\ufb01cally with plasma proteins or normal cells during circulation. In contrast, stimuli-responsive drug delivery systems modify nanocarriers by incorporating responsive moieties, enabling size adjustments, alteration of surface charge, or reversible expo- sure of targeting ligands. This approach ensures that nanocarriers possess the necessary characteristics for effective penetration of drugs in the tissues, as well as drug accumulation at targeted sites, cellular absorption, and regulated release. These intelligent DDSs promise targeted delivery of medicinal drugs with increased thera- peutic ef\ufb01cacy and decreased side effects.

These intelligent DDSs promise targeted delivery of medicinal drugs with increased thera- peutic ef\ufb01cacy and decreased side effects. By combining functional groups that react to different tumor-associated signals, the design strategy underlying these DDSs takes use of the unique physico- chemical distinctions between cancer and normal cells. 5 Nanoparticle-Based Smart Drug Delivery Systems Smart drug delivery systems aim to achieve ef\ufb01cient and targeted cancer therapy by utilizing nanoparticles, which provide an excel- lent platform for this purpose. Combining nanotechnology with smart drug delivery systems has shown great promise in reducing the side effects of chemotherapy compared to traditional drug delivery methods. Here\u2019s how these advanced systems work and why they are more effective: 1.

Controlled Release \u2022 Temporal Control: Nanoparticles can be designed to release drugs at controlled rates, ensuring a sustained therapeutic effect. \u2022 Stimuli-Responsive Release: Some nanoparticles release their payload in response to speci\ufb01c stimuli (e.g., pH changes, temperature, or light) found in the tumor microenvironment. 3. Improved Solubility and Stability \u2022 Enhanced Solubility: Nanoparticles can improve the solubil- ity of hydrophobic drugs, increasing their bioavailability. \u2022 Stability: Encapsulation in nanoparticles can protect drugs from degradation before they reach the target site. 4. Reduced Dosage and Frequency \u2022 Ef\ufb01ciency: By ensuring more of the drug reaches the cancer cells, the overall dosage can be reduced. \u2022 Extended Circulation Time: Nanoparticles can circulate in the bloodstream for longer periods, reducing the frequency of administration. 5. Minimized Side Effects \u2022 Reduced Off-Target Effects: Targeted delivery minimizes the exposure of healthy tissues to toxic chemotherapy agents. \u2022 Lower Systemic Toxicity: Controlled release and precise tar- geting lead to lower systemic toxicity and fewer side effects like nausea, hair loss, and immunosuppression. 5.1 Nanoparticle- Based Stimulus- Responsive Drug Delivery Systems (DDSs) For developing stimulus-responsive drug delivery systems (DDSs), the nanoparticles can be engineered to respond to a variety of exogenous (like temperature, light, ultrasound, electric \ufb01eld, and magnetic \ufb01eld) or endogenous (like pH, enzymes, or redox gradi- ents) stimuli in a way that they selectively release their therapeutic payload at tumor locations.

Enhanced Therapeutic Effects: By targeting drug release to tumor sites, these nanoparticles can achieve more effective treatment outcomes. 3. Prevention of Drug Leakage: The design of these systems helps prevent premature drug release in the bloodstream, reducing off-target side effects.", "Drug Delivery to Cancer: Targeting the Tumor Microenvironment 219 In summary, stimuli-responsive nanoparticles represent a highly explored and promising approach in smart drug delivery systems, providing ef\ufb01cient and targeted cancer therapy while mini- mizing adverse effects. 5.1.1 Endogenous Stimulus-Responsive Drug Delivery Systems (DDSs) When compared to healthy tissues, tumor tissues have unique biological traits such as elevated redox potential, low pH, hypoxia, and overexpression of certain enzymes. Taking advantage of these variations, redox-, pH-, and enzyme-responsive DDSs have been carefully created for tailored release and intelligent drug loading, thereby improving therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy. (a) pH-Responsive DDSs The breaking of acid-labile bonds and structural or solubility alterations of polymers with ionizable functional groups are the basis for the construction of pH-responsive DDSs. These systems exploit the pH gradients found at various levels within the body, including organ, tissue, and cellular levels, to achieve targeted drug delivery and release. \u2022 Polymer-Based Strategy: Polymers with ionizable groups (such as amines and carboxylic acids) undergo protonation or deproto- nation in response to pH changes, altering their solubility or structure to release drugs. \u2022 Acid-Labile Bonds: Acidic settings can cause chemical bonds, such as hydrazone, ester, imine, oxime, and ketal to cleave, allowing medications speci\ufb01cally designed for acidic environ- ments to be released. The pH gradients across the body provide multiple targets for these DDSs: 1. Organ Level: The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) features signi\ufb01- cant pH variations, from the acidic stomach to the alkaline intestines. pH-responsive polymers can protect drugs in the stomach and release them in the i", "ltiple targets for these DDSs: 1. Organ Level: The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) features signi\ufb01- cant pH variations, from the acidic stomach to the alkaline intestines. pH-responsive polymers can protect drugs in the stomach and release them in the intestines, aiding in colorectal cancer therapy. 2. Tissue Level: The extracellular pH of tumor microenvironments is slightly acidic (pH 6.7\u20137.1) compared to healthy tissue (pH 7.4). DDSs can be engineered to respond sharply to these subtle pH differences for targeted drug release. For example, ultra-pH-sensitive (UPS) nanotechnology uses block copolymers with ionizable tertiary amine groups for precise pH-triggered drug release and cancer theranostics. 3. Cellular Level: The pH within endocytic organelles (early endosome, late endosome, lysosome) is much lower than in the cytoplasm. pH-responsive DDSs can trigger drug release in these acidic compartments, ensuring organelle-speci\ufb01c", "activation. These systems are also designed to facilitate endo- somal escape and cytosolic delivery, particularly for macromo- lecules such as proteins and siRNA. 220 Sonal Saxena et al. (b) Redox-Responsive DDSs The redox environment within tumor tissues differs signi\ufb01- cantly from that of normal tissues, primarily due to elevated levels of glutathione (GSH) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Redox- responsive DDSs exploit these differences to achieve targeted intra- cellular drug delivery: \u2022 Disul\ufb01de Bonds: Disul\ufb01de bonds are commonly used due to their fast cleavage by GSH, enabling the release of drugs within the reductive environment of tumor cells. \u2022 ROS-Responsive DDSs: These systems utilize linkages like thio- ketal, thioether, peroxalate ester, and boronic ester that respond to high ROS levels in tumor tissues, triggering drug release. (c) Enzyme-Responsive DDSs Tumors often overexpress speci\ufb01c enzymes, such as proteases, phospholipases, and peptidases, which can be harnessed as triggers for enzyme-responsive DDSs. These systems can function in several ways: \u2022 Enzyme-Triggered Drug Release: Nanocarriers can be con- structed with enzyme-sensitive scaffolds or linkers that release drugs upon enzymatic cleavage. \u2022 Prodrugs and Ligand Activation: Enzyme-sensitive bonds can activate prodrugs, ligands, or probes speci\ufb01cally in tumor environments. \u2022 Detachable PEGylation Layers: Enzyme-activated detachable PEG layers can enhance blood circulation and increase cellular internalization at target sites. Challenges include the similarity in active sites and catalytic mechanisms among enzymes and the variability in enzyme expres- sion levels within different tumors and individuals. 5.1.2 Exogenous Stimulus-Responsive DDSs Exogenous stimuli-responsive DDSs offer precise cont", "similarity in active sites and catalytic mechanisms among enzymes and the variability in enzyme expres- sion levels within different tumors and individuals. 5.1.2 Exogenous Stimulus-Responsive DDSs Exogenous stimuli-responsive DDSs offer precise control over drug release by utilizing external triggers such as light, tempera- ture, ultrasound, magnetic \ufb01elds, and electric \ufb01elds. These systems provide targeted and controlled drug delivery, maximizing thera- peutic ef\ufb01cacy while minimizing side effects. (a) Temperature-Responsive DDSs Temperature-responsive DDSs release drugs in response to temperature changes, particularly in the range of 40 \u00b0C or higher. Common materials include poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide)", "(PNIPAM) and poly(2-oxazoline)s (POxs), which undergo phase changes at speci\ufb01c temperatures to release their cargo. Drug Delivery to Cancer: Targeting the Tumor Microenvironment 221 (b) Light-Responsive DDSs Light-responsive DDSs, particularly those activated by near- infrared (NIR) light, allow remote control over drug release through photoisomerization, photocleavage, and photothermal/ photodynamic effects. These systems can achieve deep tissue pene- tration and precise control over irradiation power and exposure time. Examples include selenium-containing polymeric nanoparti- cles and bifunctional light-responsive platinum nanocomplexes that synergistically combine photothermal and chemotherapy. (c) Ultrasound-Responsive DDSs Ultrasound-responsive DDSs leverage high-frequency ultra- sound waves to trigger drug release, enhance tumor permeability, and improve drug accumulation at tumor sites. They also utilize physical effects such as cavitation and local hyperthermia to achieve targeted delivery. (d) Electric Field-Responsive DDSs Electric \ufb01eld-responsive DDSs use conductive polymers and materials to control drug release through electrochemical pro- cesses. Electroporation can also enhance drug permeability through cell membranes, facilitating the delivery of macromolecules like proteins and genes. (e) Magnetic Field-Responsive DDSs Magnetic \ufb01eld-responsive DDSs incorporate magnetic materi- als like superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) to achieve targeted drug delivery under an external magnetic \ufb01eld. These systems can also generate local hyperthermia for on-demand drug release. (f) Other Exogenous Stimuli-Responsive DDSs Other stimuli-responsive DDSs include systems triggered by high-energy radiation (e.g., X-rays) and other physical or chemical stimul", "systems can also generate local hyperthermia for on-demand drug release. (f) Other Exogenous Stimuli-Responsive DDSs Other stimuli-responsive DDSs include systems triggered by high-energy radiation (e.g., X-rays) and other physical or chemical stimuli. These systems offer opportunities for overcoming biological barriers, reversing multidrug resistance, and integrating novel therapeutic modalities such as photodynamic and photother- mal therapy. 5.2 Receptor- Ligand-Based Smart DDS Targeted delivery is a crucial aspect of modern smart drug delivery systems (DDSs). Tumor-targeting drug delivery can be achieved through two main strategies: passive targeting and active targeting. While passive targeting has been the focus of many studies, its ef\ufb01ciency, particularly the enhanced permeability and retention", "(EPR) effect, has come under scrutiny. Li et al. [8] demonstrated that receptor-mediated targeting (active targeting) contributed more to the accumulation of nanoparticles (NPs) in tumors over time compared to the EPR effect. They highlighted that NP trans- portation through gaps between endothelial cells in tumor blood vessels was a signi\ufb01cant factor in the EPR effect. However, Sindhwani et al. recently found that these gaps covered only 0.048% of the blood vessel surface area, suggesting that passive targeting alone cannot account for the observed NP accumulation in tumors. This has shifted the focus toward a combination of passive and active targeting in cancer nanomedicine research. Active targeting, however, faces challenges such as unwanted interactions with non-target sites. This can result in on-target off-tumor effects through both nonspeci\ufb01c and selective interactions with target and non-target locations expressing pertinent receptors at varying degrees. Numerous tactics have been put out to address these problems. To improve tumor penetration and cellular absorption, Wang et al. [18], for instance, created tumor acidity-responsive nanoparticles that expose the targeted ligand in the acidic tumor microenvironment while shielding it from systemic circulation. 222 Sonal Saxena et al. 5.2.1 The Effect of Spatial Distribution of Ligands on Drug Delivery Traditionally, ligands are attached to drug-delivery vehicles like liposomes, nanoparticles, or micelles in required quantities, and increasing ligand density can enhance targeting effectiveness to a certain extent. However, ligands are typically randomly distributed on the vehicle surface due to their symmetrical structure, which limits receptor recognition and ligand utilization. High ligand density can also lead", "ce targeting effectiveness to a certain extent. However, ligands are typically randomly distributed on the vehicle surface due to their symmetrical structure, which limits receptor recognition and ligand utilization. High ligand density can also lead to protein corona formation with plasma- binding proteins during blood circulation, causing off-target effects, rapid clearance, and increased immunogenicity. For instance, folic acid-modi\ufb01ed liposomes can adsorb large amounts of natural IgM post-injection, resulting in unexpected off-target effects. By adjusting the multivalent ligands\u2019 presentation mode to produce an uneven ligand distribution, these problems can be mitigated. This strategy improves speci\ufb01city, targeting ef\ufb01ciency, and ligand utilization. Lipid-based vesicles containing HER-2-tar- geting short peptides (KCCYSL) were created by [13]. These vesi- cles, often referred to as sticky vesicles, partition ligands inside the lipid phase-separated domain in the acidic tumor interstitium (pH 6.0\u20137.0) and distribute them uniformly throughout their surface during circulation (pH 7.4). As a result, there is an increase in local ligand density and target tissue recognition and a decrease in interactions with normal cells that have low receptor expression. This leads to low reactivity in the circulation and high reactivity even in cells with few target receptors. Similar to this, Poon et al. used hydrophilic/hydrophobic interaction to create self- assembling linear dendritic polymers (LDPs). Their experiments", "showed that increasing ligand density did not linearly increase targeting effectiveness but reached saturation dynamics. Beyond a certain point, excess ligands in a small binding area caused steric binding interference, lowering binding energy. According to their research, concentrating on the precise modi\ufb01cation of ligand clus- ter presentation on molecularly targeted NPs may have a major effect on cell targeting and result in the creation of more ef\ufb01cient targeted delivery systems. Drug Delivery to Cancer: Targeting the Tumor Microenvironment 223 5.2.2 Dynamic Strategies for Tumor Targeting Dynamic tumor targeting strategies involve adaptable drug delivery systems capable of adjusting their properties to optimize drug release in response to speci\ufb01c conditions within the tumor micro- environment. Traditional approaches often fall short due to inade- quate circulation time, limited tumor speci\ufb01city, and poor penetration into tumor tissues. To address these challenges, nano- particles (NPs) are engineered with tailored physicochemical prop- erties that ensure prolonged circulation in the bloodstream and enable rapid drug release upon encountering tumor-speci\ufb01c signals, such as acidic pH or overexpressed enzymes [3]. (a) Size Shrinkage Targeting Effective drug delivery relies on nanoparticles that can \ufb01rst accumulate around leaky blood vessels via the enhanced permeabil- ity and retention (EPR) effect and then penetrate deep into tumor tissues for optimal therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy [13, 15]. Research indicates that NPs around 100 nm in diameter achieve optimal circulation and tumor accumulation, while smaller NPs (<30 nm) demon- strate superior penetration into tumor interstitial spaces [2, 4, 11, 17]. Size shrinkage targeting addresses this by integrating smaller NPs within lar", "in diameter achieve optimal circulation and tumor accumulation, while smaller NPs (<30 nm) demon- strate superior penetration into tumor interstitial spaces [2, 4, 11, 17]. Size shrinkage targeting addresses this by integrating smaller NPs within larger carriers that initially maintain a size conducive to circulation and accumulation but shrink upon exposure to speci\ufb01c tumor signals. For instance, strategies involving MMP-2 cleavable peptides have shown promising results, enabling NPs to transition from larger to smaller sizes in response to MMP-2 activity, and facilitating deeper tumor penetration [6, 7]. (b) Surface Charge Switchable Targeting Surface charge plays a crucial role in determining NP interac- tions with biological systems. NPs with neutral or negative charges exhibit prolonged circulation by avoiding interactions with blood proteins and immune cells. However, once at the tumor site, pH-responsive NPs can undergo a charge conversion (from nega- tive to positive) in the slightly acidic tumor microenvironment (pH ~6.8). This conversion enhances NP binding to negatively charged cell membranes, promoting cellular uptake and internali- zation. Key pH-responsive moieties, such as CDM and DMMA, enable this charge switch, enhancing the therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy of NPs by improving their tumor-speci\ufb01c interactions [5, 9, 14].", "224 Sonal Saxena et al. (c) Surface Ligand Activatable Targeting Active targeting employs speci\ufb01c ligands on NP surfaces to bind receptors or antigens overexpressed by cancer cells, enhancing selective uptake and internalization into tumor cells. However, conventional ligand-targeting strategies often suffer from non-speci\ufb01c interactions with healthy tissues during circulation. To mitigate this, smart ligand-targeting strategies shield these ligands during circulation and activate them upon reaching the tumor site. For example, stimuli-responsive modi\ufb01cations of cell- penetrating peptides (CPPs) allow for controlled activation of ligand exposure in response to tumor-speci\ufb01c cues, improving the targeting precision and therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy of NPs [10, 18]. 6 Challenges and Opportunities for Targeted Delivery to Cancer Cells \u2022 Complexity of the TME: The TME\u2019s heterogeneity and dynamic nature pose challenges for targeted therapies, requiring compre- hensive approaches that consider interactions between different components. \u2022 Resistance Mechanisms: TME-mediated resistance mechanisms can limit the ef\ufb01cacy of therapies. Understanding these mechan- isms is crucial for developing combinatorial approaches that enhance treatment outcomes. 7 Future Directions \u2022 Combination Therapies: Integrating therapies that target multi- ple components of the TME (e.g., immune cells, vasculature, ECM) holds promise for overcoming resistance and improving patient outcomes. \u2022 Enhancing Speci\ufb01city and Ef\ufb01cacy: Continued research aims to improve the speci\ufb01city and ef\ufb01cacy of therapies by optimizing their binding af\ufb01nity, internalization ef\ufb01ciency, and therapeutic payload delivery. \u2022 Personalized Medicine: Tailoring TME-targeted therapies based on individual tumor characteristics and patient immune p", "i\ufb01city and ef\ufb01cacy of therapies by optimizing their binding af\ufb01nity, internalization ef\ufb01ciency, and therapeutic payload delivery. \u2022 Personalized Medicine: Tailoring TME-targeted therapies based on individual tumor characteristics and patient immune pro\ufb01les could optimize treatment ef\ufb01cacy. 8 Conclusions TME represents a critical determinant of cancer progression and therapeutic response. Targeted therapies aimed at disrupting TME interactions are advancing rapidly, offering new avenues for", "improving cancer treatment outcomes and patient survival. The \ufb01eld is moving toward developing site-directed anti-cancer strate- gies based on selective receptor expression on tumor cells and vasculature. Synthetic peptides mimicking ligands for tumor over- expressed receptors represent a promising avenue for developing next-generation cancer therapeutics. Continued research and clini- cal development are essential to harnessing the full potential of TME-targeted therapies in oncology. The ongoing research aims to optimize therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy while minimizing side effects, paving the way for innovative and personalized cancer treatments in the future. The ability of tumor-homing peptides to deliver therapeutic cargo directly to target cells marks a signi\ufb01cant advancement in the evolution of cancer therapy strategies. Tumor-homing peptides represent a promising approach in perso- nalized medicine for cancer treatment and diagnostics, leveraging their ability to selectively target and interact with tumor cells based on unique molecular markers. The advancement of nanotechnol- ogy has indeed positioned nanoparticles as a promising candidate for controlled drug delivery systems (DDS). These nanoscale car- riers offer several unique advantages that make them suitable for precise, ef\ufb01cient, and safe drug delivery, particularly in the context of complex diseases such as cancer. Continued research and clinical development are expected to expand their applications and improve outcomes for cancer patients.

Ahmad, and Kamal Pant Abstract Recent advancements in biosensor design and sensing effectiveness should be integrated with research on responsive drug delivery systems to enhance health management and ensure patient compliance. Many illnesses require continuous monitoring to enable timely intervention. Physicochemical changes in the body can indicate the onset of illness before symptoms appear. Despite diagnostic and prognostic biosensors, medical interventions still face challenges. Delayed detection can reduce therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy, and conven- tional treatments may cause side effects such as tissue damage and hepatic and renal toxicity. Drug delivery systems offer a way to minimize side effects and improve patient adherence. Chronic illnesses necessitate ongoing monitoring and effective treatment strategies. Designing responsive systems that react to physicochemical changes can enhance therapeutic outcomes. Integrating biosensors with drug delivery in implantable closed-loop systems allows for timely therapeutic interventions triggered by illness biomarkers. Proper biomarker selection is crucial for accurate diagnosis and effective responsive drug delivery. Detecting illness early based on biomarker levels can tailor therapeu- tic dosing to the severity of physiological changes. This review explores various biosensors and drug delivery systems, highlighting challenges and future prospects for their integration in detecting and managing chronic illnesses.

In traditional delivery system, a drug to be effective needs regular administration and continuous monitoring. The challeng- ing part in therapy of diseases like cardiovascular dysfunctions, diabetes mellitus, and cancers is monitoring of \ufb02uctuating in blood pressure levels of lipids, sugars and cancerous cells in mitotic phase of, need to be monitored regularly for titration of dose. A biosensor is a device that combines a biological element with a transducer to detect and measure a speci\ufb01c biological or chemical analyte. It converts the biochemical signals produced by interac- tions between the biological element and the target analyte into measurable electrical, optical, or other quanti\ufb01able signals. Biosensor-integrated drug delivery systems have been studied exhaustively for therapeutics of lifestyle ailments like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, and cancer. Biosensors can detect changes in pH and temperature, which are critical parameters in certain drug delivery applications. For instance, pH-sensitive biosensors can be used in targeted drug delivery systems to release drugs in response to speci\ufb01c pH condi- tions in a particular tissue or organ. Biosensors enable real-time monitoring and data collection, allowing for personalized medicine approaches. By tracking patient-speci\ufb01c parameters, such as genetic factors or physiological responses, biosensors can help optimize drug delivery and tailor treatment plans to individual patients. Overall, biosensors in drug delivery systems provide valuable insights into patient health, drug ef\ufb01cacy, and treatment optimiza- tion.

The bio-recognition element is the analyte and bioreceptor. The Fig. 1 Functional components of a biosensor", "bio-recognition element of the sensor identi\ufb01es the target analyte, while a transducer converts the result of the molecular recognition into an electrical signal. Different biomolecules such as enzymes, nucleic acids, antibodies, proteins, and peptides can be used as a bio-recognition element and biosensors can thus be used to detect speci\ufb01c physiochemical changes in the body (associated with the diseases) with high sensitivity and speci\ufb01city. The performance of the biosensors can be optimized on the basis of selectivity, sensitiv- ity, linearity, response time, reproducibility and stability. Biosensor-Based Drug Delivery Systems: Innovations, Applications, and\u2026 229 Biosensors can be integrated into drug delivery devices to provide feedback on drug levels and trigger drug release when needed. These systems can maintain therapeutic drug concentra- tions and avoid under- or over-dosing. For instance, biosensor- controlled insulin pumps can measure glucose levels and release insulin accordingly in diabetic patients [1]. It is important to mention here that an in-depth knowledge of the physiology, pathophysiology of the disease, and pharmacody- namics and pharmacokinetics are sine qua non for development of biosensor-based drug formulations. 2.1 Types of Biosensors Different types of biosensors featuring drug delivery systems have been developed with the ability to deliver drugs in response to biosensor readings. It is important here to know about the funda- mental structuring and classi\ufb01cation of a biosensor based on its components and functioning. The bioreceptors are considered as the primary component in biosensor construction. Based on the bioreceptor, biosensors are classi\ufb01ed as enzymatic biosensors (most common biosensor class), immunosensors (possess high speci\ufb01city", "ents and functioning. The bioreceptors are considered as the primary component in biosensor construction. Based on the bioreceptor, biosensors are classi\ufb01ed as enzymatic biosensors (most common biosensor class), immunosensors (possess high speci\ufb01city and sensitivity and are speci\ufb01cally useful in diagnosis), aptamer or nucleic acid-based bio- sensors (possess high speci\ufb01city for microbial strains and nucleic acid-containing analyte), and microbial or whole-cell biosensors. The second classi\ufb01cation is made on the basis of the transducer and sensors which are categorized as electrochemical (which is further grouped as potentiometric, amperometric, impedance, and conductometric), electronic biosensor, thermal biosensor, optical, and mass-based or gravimetric. Some classi\ufb01cations are made depending on the detection sys- tem (optical, electrical, electronic, thermal, mechanical, and mag- netic) and rest on the technology (nano, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), biosensors-on-chip (lab-on-chip), electrometers, and deployable). Several types of biosensors have been described here. 2.1.1 Bio-Micro-Electro- Mechanical Systems (Bio- MEMS) The development of Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) devices involves a micro-fabrication process utilizing materials such as silicon, glass, and plastic. The process begins with patterning techniques, where photolithography creates desired patterns on the", "wafer surface. The wafer is coated with photoresist and exposed to radiation through a mask, transferring the pattern before the pho- toresist is removed [2]. 230 Disha Pant et al. Next, a deposition process applies thin \ufb01lms of various materi- als, such as bioelectronics, polymers like polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, metals for electrodes, or biomolecules, onto the wafer surface. This is followed by etching, which can be either wet (using liquid chemicals) or dry (involving gas-phase chemis- try). Wet etching can be isotropic, etching equally in all directions and causing mask undercutting with a rounded etch pro\ufb01le, or anisotropic, which is directional etching induced by chemical or physical means. The \ufb01nal step is bonding, where two substrates are joined together through anodic or fusion bonding techniques [2]. BioMEMS technology has advanced the fabrication of both disposable and implantable drug delivery systems and diagnostic tools. MEMS technology has enabled the creation of micro\ufb02uidic devices, designed for sensing, pumping, mixing, monitoring, and controlling small \ufb02uid volumes. Microneedles, including solid, durable, solid degradable, and hollow types, are used for insulin delivery (e.g., Jewel Pump by Debiotech) and vaccination (e.g., Intaza by Sano\ufb01 Pasteur) [3]. Implantable drug delivery microde- vices developed with BioMEMS technology aim to address chal- lenges associated with conventional implantable devices, such as unintended drug release (Fig. 2). Implantable MEMS drug delivery devices contain reservoirs loaded with drugs, which are crucial components. The reservoir materials must be biocompatible externally and inert internally to prevent drug interactions. Common materials include PDMS", ". 2). Implantable MEMS drug delivery devices contain reservoirs loaded with drugs, which are crucial components. The reservoir materials must be biocompatible externally and inert internally to prevent drug interactions. Common materials include PDMS, polyacrylamide, medical-grade silicone rubber, and Pyrex\u00a9 due to their desirable properties like biocompatibility, bonding, and opti- cal transparency. Advances in microfabrication have enabled the creation of appropriately sized reservoirs that balance drug load Fig. 2 Biosensors and drug delivery systems", "capacity and effective drug release mechanisms without signi\ufb01cantly increasing device size. Miniaturization is essential for initial animal testing and eventual human application, ensuring precise and con- trollable drug delivery. Biosensor-Based Drug Delivery Systems: Innovations, Applications, and\u2026 231 Micropumps are crucial components in micro\ufb02uidic drug deliv- ery devices, enabling precise control over drug dosage and release rate in targeted tissues. They can be programmed to administer drugs consistently, preventing \ufb02uctuations in drug levels in the bloodstream. Key parameters for micropumps include size, low heat generation, precise metering, low power consumption, and system integration. Micropumps are classi\ufb01ed into mechanical (e.g., piezoelectric, magnetic) and non-mechanical (e.g., electro- chemical) types, both of which can be miniaturized for implanta- tion. The need for an external power source and the energy required for operation are critical factors affecting the feasibility of implantation. Through BioMEMS technology, a piezoelectric pump- controlled drug delivery system has been developed for transdermal insulin delivery via microneedles, improving precision and accuracy compared to mechanically controlled pumps [4]. To enhance lon- gevity and biocompatibility, future BioMEMS devices may utilize biodegradable polymers or compounds that mitigate tissue responses, such as antibiotics or anti-in\ufb02ammatory agents [5].

While designing the size of the pumping device of MEMS- based delivery systems, its energy consumption, shelf life, and inability to interfere with physiology and feasibility of implantation have to be kept in mind. Among the available options, mechanical pumps like piezoelectric, magnetic and non- mechanical pumps like electrochemical induced forces based pumps are preferred. Mechanical micropumps conceptualize oscillating diaphragms for moving \ufb02uids across pressure gradient. They push and halt \ufb02uid and develop a pulsating \ufb02ow due to their periodicity. Their general construction includes a \ufb02exible membrane or diaphragm, an actua- tor, a pumping chamber, an inlet, and an outlet. Mechanical micropumps, also known as displacement micro- pumps, utilize the movement of components like oscillating dia- phragms to pump \ufb02uids by applying pressure. These pumps generate a pulsating \ufb02ow due to their periodic operation and con- sist of key components such as a \ufb02exible membrane or diaphragm, an actuator, a pumping chamber, an inlet, and an outlet. The oscillatory movement of the membrane, driven by a physical actua- tor, creates the pressure difference needed for \ufb02uid pumping. Common driving forces in mechanical micropumps for MEMS drug delivery devices include piezoelectric, magnetic, and material phase change mechanisms. Non-mechanical micropumps generate \ufb02uid \ufb02ow by directly exerting forces on the liquid without involving any structural movement. These systems convert a non-mechanical energy source into kinetic energy and typically have a limited \ufb02ow rate and slower response compared to mechanical micropumps. They often require interaction with a working solution possessing speci\ufb01c electrical properties, such as conductivity. Despite these limitations, non-", "energy and typically have a limited \ufb02ow rate and slower response compared to mechanical micropumps. They often require interaction with a working solution possessing speci\ufb01c electrical properties, such as conductivity. Despite these limitations, non-mechanical micropumps are valuable in drug delivery applica- tions due to their low power consumption. Common actuation methods include electro-hydro-dynamic, magneto-hydrodynamic, electro-osmotic, and electrochemical forces, with electrochemical forces being particularly relevant for drug release applications. Another group of MEMS devices for drug release applications utilizes multiple reservoirs, each designed to deliver a single dose of the loaded drug. These devices employ various actuation mechan- isms to achieve precise and controlled release by promoting the dissolution or rupture of the reservoir capping membranes. Nota- bly, an implantable multi-reservoir device was developed for passive release of chemotherapeutic drugs to test tumor sensitivity in vivo. This device, implanted through a biopsy needle, directly deliv- ered drugs into tumor tissue without systemic exposure, using micromachined Delrin acetal resin blocks with 3\u201330 circular reser- voirs for passive drug release over 24 h. Techniques such as mod- ifying reservoir opening size, using polymer matrices to control drug diffusion, and employing hydrophilic hydrogels to eject", "drugs were employed to control the release pro\ufb01le. Additionally, combining drugs in a single reservoir allowed testing of up to 16 drug combinations, enabling optimization of drug therapy before systemic treatment.

These polymers are categorized into three forms based on their physical properties: linear free chains in solutions collapse reversibly upon stimulus application; covalently cross-linked revers- ible gels swell or shrink in response to environmental changes; and chain adsorbed or surface-grafted polymers exhibit reversible swelling or collapse on surfaces when triggers are altered [15, 16]. They have the ability to deliver drugs when needed. One such example is the attachment of both glucose oxidase and insulin within a hydrogel", "face-grafted polymers exhibit reversible swelling or collapse on surfaces when triggers are altered [15, 16]. They have the ability to deliver drugs when needed. One such example is the attachment of both glucose oxidase and insulin within a hydrogel that is responsive to changes in pH, enabling this smart polymer to act both as a sensor of glucose concentration and as a drug delivery vehicle for insulin [17]. These types of", "biosensor-drug delivery systems can reduce the risk of overdosing/ underdosing a patient while allowing the patient to receive the drug at a speci\ufb01c time point. 234 Disha Pant et al. 2.1.3 Microfabricated Devices Most microfabricated devices function as biosensors, but their utility is often restricted by a short lifespan. Designing implantable biosensors with extended functionality is critical for optimal closed- loop drug delivery or monitoring systems. Addressing challenges such as implant biocompatibility and biofouling is essential for maintaining long-term in vivo sensing. Enhancing the integration of drug delivery systems with bio- sensor technology can be achieved using hydrogels sensitive to thermal, pH, ionic strength, or biomolecular changes. These mate- rials improve biocompatibility and reduce biofouling. Innovatively, a cantilever can act as a lid on reservoirs, where a responsive hydrogel containing sensing molecules can control the lid\u2019s opening and closing based on analyte levels. Electrically responsive hydrogels can also be used in MEMS-based sensors or drug delivery devices, enabling external electrical stimulation to trigger drug release. MEMS technology has been utilized to create microparticles and micro-reservoirs for drug delivery. Microparticles are produced by forming arrays of wells, 25\u2013100 \u03bcm in size, within silicon squares measuring 80\u2013150 \u03bcm. These wells are \ufb01lled with drugs and sealed with dissolvable caps that adhere to target sites due to bioadhesive properties, allowing precise drug delivery. Smart polymers capable of shrinking upon analyte detection can enhance these microparti- cles, enabling responsive drug release and integration with biosensors. For example, micro-reservoirs are made from silicon and capped with gold membranes tha", "y. Smart polymers capable of shrinking upon analyte detection can enhance these microparti- cles, enabling responsive drug release and integration with biosensors. For example, micro-reservoirs are made from silicon and capped with gold membranes that rupture upon voltage stimula- tion. Instead of voltage, smart polymers can collapse in response to analyte concentrations or use conductive polymers activated during redox reactions. Overall, microfabricated devices have revolutio- nized the development of controlled-release microchips [2]. Lab-on-a-chip systems have the edge of rapid and improved data analysis, and portability of the devices, allowing point of care diagnosis and treatment. Incorporation of a micro-reservoir drug depot, micro-pump, valves, and sensors onto BioMEMS devices allowed responsive and controlled release of drug. This increases bioavailability and reduces incidences of toxicity. A new controlled-release microchip has been developed using silicon wafers and various drug reservoirs for both single and mul- tiple drug release [18]. By incorporating drug-loaded hydrogels, biosensors, and responsive elements, these devices can interact more seamlessly with biological environments. This integration allows pharmaceutical devices to operate more autonomously within their surroundings, reducing the need for constant human oversight.", "Biosensor-Based Drug Delivery Systems: Innovations, Applications, and\u2026 235 Microchips are manufactured using MEMS technology by initi- ally choosing a biocompatible substrate and etching micro- reservoirs to contain therapeutic solutions. The next step involves selecting a conductive sealant, a thin membrane that doubles as an anode. The membrane is speci\ufb01cally chosen to maintain structural integrity in a solution without an applied electrical potential, pre- venting dissolution or rupture. When considering in vivo implantation, it is crucial to account for the presence of oxygen and chloride ions, which can cause metal corrosion. Microchips offer numerous advantages, such as the abil- ity to pattern multiple micro-reservoirs for holding various drugs. This design prevents mechanical breakdown or drug leakage that may occur due to incomplete lid closure, as there are no moving parts, unlike glucose biosensors. Moreover, microchips eliminate the need for patient or doctor intervention to ensure functionality and can support closed-loop systems when integrated with biosen- sors. Designing disposable chips can further enhance both biosen- sor and drug delivery systems [2]. 2.2 Bioreceptor- Based Biosensors Based upon the bioreceptors, biosensors are categorized as follows. 2.2.1 Enzyme-Based Biosensors These are most common biosensors utilized for detection of \ufb02uc- tuating glucose and urea levels in the body. The working principle of an enzyme-based biosensor depends on the catalytic reaction and binding capabilities for the target analyte detection. The concen- tration of enzyme-based biosensors alters depending upon the catalytic transformation of the analyte by the enzyme, inactivation or activation by analyte, and tracking of the alteration of enzyme characteristics. H", "rget analyte detection. The concen- tration of enzyme-based biosensors alters depending upon the catalytic transformation of the analyte by the enzyme, inactivation or activation by analyte, and tracking of the alteration of enzyme characteristics. However, the enzyme structure is extremely sensi- tive, which makes it expensive and complicated to improve its sensitivity, stability, and adaptability [19]. 2.2.2 Antibody-Based Biosensors These have an embedded antibody as ligand or they function on the antibody\u2013antigen interaction is called immunosensors. Non-labeled immunosensors are constructed to speci\ufb01cally deter- mine the antigen\u2013antibody complex by estimating the physical changes caused by the development of the complex. In the case of labeled immunosensor, a sensitively detectable label is introduced. Madurro et al. constructed a label-free immunosensor to detect ovarian cancer. The system has a linear relationship of anti-CA125 concentration in the range of 5\u201380 U mL-1 , exhibiting a limit of detection of 1.45 U mL-1 [19]. 2.2.3 Aptamer-Based Biosensors These biosensors utilize aptamers which are synthetic single- stranded nucleic acids (sequences of DNA or RNA) that bind to target molecules selectively and can be folded into two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) structures. In 2D or 3D", "structures, the targets have high-binding performance due to greater surface density and less spatial blocking. Due to the nucleic acid character of aptamers, they are structurally and functionally stable over a wide range of temperatures and storage conditions. Unlike antibodies that require biological systems to be generated, aptamers can be chemically synthesized, are stable in a pH range of 2\u201312, and have certain thermal refolding capabilities. A further bene\ufb01t of aptamers is that they can be chemically modi\ufb01ed accord- ing to the detection criteria for the target molecule. 236 Disha Pant et al. By an in vitro selection mechanism, SELEX (Systematic Evolu- tion of Ligands by EXponential enrichment), aptamers can be isolated from oligonucleotides libraries. Several SELEX variants have recently been established, including cell- SELEX, capillary electrophoresis-based SELEX, micro\ufb02uidics-SELEX, FACS-based SELEX, microtiter plate-SELEX, magnetic bead SELEX, and in vivo SELEX. Optical, electrochemical, and piezoelectric techni- ques are the most frequently used in biosensors [19]. Depending on different transduction techniques, these biosen- sors are further categorized as labeled or label-free aptasensors. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is the most commonly used method for the label-free optical sensors, whereas \ufb02uorescent dyes (\ufb02uorescein) are used for label-based optical aptasensors. For track- ing biological systems in real time, \ufb02uorescent NPs, such as QDs, provide many bene\ufb01ts over regular \ufb02uorescent dyes. To identify targets, such as cancer cells, bacterial spores, and proteins, aptamer- QD conjugates were used. Aptamer capped NIR PbS QDs have been designed to detect thrombin protein, based on selective charge transfer, within 1 min and with a detection limit of ~1 ", "gets, such as cancer cells, bacterial spores, and proteins, aptamer- QD conjugates were used. Aptamer capped NIR PbS QDs have been designed to detect thrombin protein, based on selective charge transfer, within 1 min and with a detection limit of ~1 nM. Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have demonstrated interesting absorp- tion characteristics that vary depending upon their aggregation state. Furthermore, GNPs are more biocompatible, easier to bio- conjugate, and less toxic than QDs [19]. 2.2.4 Whole-Cell-Based Biosensors These utilize microbes (bacterial, fungi (yeasts and molds), algae, protozoa, and viruses), since they possess potential biorecognition elements, in the construction of whole-cell-based biosensors. They are self-replicating and can produce recognition elements, such as antibodies, without the need for extraction and puri\ufb01cation. Com- pared with animal or plant cells, whole-cell-based biosensors are easy to handle and rapidly proliferating. The cells can interact with a wide variety of analytes, display the electrochemical response that a transducer can register, and can transmit (whole-cell-based biosen- sor principle). Owing to their good sensitivity, high selectivity, and capability of detection, these biosensors were successfully employed in environmental monitoring, food analysis, pharmacology, heavy metals, pesticides, detection of organic contaminants, and drug screening. A label-free optical whole-cell Escherichia coli biosensor", "has been developed to detect pyrethroid insecticide exposure with a detection limit of 3 ng mL-1 in the linear range of 0.01\u20132 ng mL-1 [19]. Biosensor-Based Drug Delivery Systems: Innovations, Applications, and\u2026 237 2.2.5 Nanoparticle- Based Biosensors Nanobiosensors operate on a similar principle to their conventional macro- and micro-scale counterparts but are built using nanoscale components for signal or data transformation. They offer unique advantages over larger counterparts due to their multidisciplinary applications enabled by their nanoscale dimensions. They are particularly valuable for electrode modi\ufb01cation, where they enhance the sensitivity and speci\ufb01city of electrochemical catal- ysis. Additionally, catalytically active nanomaterials, such as transi- tion metal oxides, have been engineered into nanoenzymes, enabling catalysis of biochemical reactions directly on biosensors. To enhance NP biosensing performance, they are often coated with various matrices such as metal oxides, silica networks, poly- mers, graphene, \ufb01bers, and dendrimers. These coatings serve to improve stability, increase speci\ufb01city, and enhance sensitivity, tailor- ing the NPs for speci\ufb01c biosensing applications. Over the past decade, metal oxide-based nanomaterials have found extensive applications across various domains such as elec- trochemistry, magnetism, catalysis, and sensor technology due to their diverse electrical, chemical, and physical properties. Among the commonly utilized metal oxide nanoparticles are copper oxide (CuO), nickel oxide (NiO), iron oxide (Fe2O3), cobalt oxide (Co3O4), manganese oxide (MnO2), zinc oxide (ZnO), titanium oxide (TiO2), tin oxide (SnO2), cadmium oxide (CdO), molybde- num oxide (MoO3), and cerium oxide (CeO2).

These nanoparticles exhibit outstanding optical, electronic, magnetic, chemical, mechanical, and catalytic properties. Gold nanoparticles (NPs), classi\ufb01ed among noble metal NPs, are extensively studied and utilized due to their remarkable optical, electronic, and physicochemical properties. They hold signi\ufb01cant advantages in biomedical research, including simple synthesis tech- niques, straightforward fabrication procedures, high chemical sta- bility, biocompatibility, wide electrochemical potential range, high catalytic activity, and versatility in nanocomposite forms. Palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) offer intriguing potential for biomedical applications due to their high catalytic and sensing activities. Additionally, palladium (Pd) is more abundant than gold (Au) and platinum (Pt), rendering it cost-effective and versa- tile for various sensing applications. Copper (Cu) has garnered signi\ufb01cant attention as a promising sensing material due to its outstanding electrical conductivity, sta- bility, electrocatalytic properties, and cost-effectiveness compared to noble metals. Recently, Huang et al. investigated electrochemical glucose sensors based on copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) loaded onto a \ufb02exible graphite sheet.", "M [ 238 Disha Pant et al.

ZnO nanoparticles are known for their good electron transfer rate, stability, biocompatibility, and high conductivity. Table 3 shows a list of heavy metal based nano- biosensors synthesized for detection of biomolecules. 3 Methods A typical biosensor comprises of \ufb01ve essential components, viz., an analyte, a bioreceptor, a transducer, electronics, and display. An analyte is a molecule whose levels are to be identi\ufb01ed. It can be glucose, calcium, or any other biomolecule which acts as a substrate to its respective bioreceptor-like enzymes, antibody, cells, aptamers, nanoparticles, etc., The tranducer then generates signals (optical/ electrical) in proportion to the intensity of analyte bioreceptor interaction (biorecognition).

The electrical signals obtained from the transducer are ampli\ufb01ed, processed, and quanti\ufb01ed by the display unit and made readable at user\u2019s end. Figure 3 expresses the complete picture of the components for a biosensor system.", "Biosensor-Based Drug Delivery Systems: Innovations, Applications, and\u2026 239 Fig. 3 The components of biosensor involved in ef\ufb01cient identi\ufb01cation of analyte. (Adapted from [19]) 3.1 Approach Toward Designing Biosensors 3.1.1 Selection of the Analyte and Bioreceptors The selection of the analyte and bioreceptor requires digging deep into reverse pharmacology. That means, the root cause of the infection and the knowledge of pathogenesis must be known to the developer. Say, for example, foot ulcers are a common problem in chronic diabetic patients. Wound healing is poor in diabetic patients due to increasing circulatory concentrations of glucose. Biosensors are designed to analyze the minute-to-minute condition of wound healing in a bandaged wound without the need of opening it and providing therapy accordingly. 3.1.2 Immobilization of Biosensors It is crucial in their synthesis, as improper or inadequate \ufb01xation of the surface can lead to enzyme leaching or inactivation. Enzymes, serving as the biorecognition element, can be immobilized using physical methods, primarily through adsorption or encapsulation. Physical adsorption involves attaching the bioreceptor onto an inert solid material through van der Waals forces, electrostatic interac- tions, ionic bonds, or hydrogen bonding. This method is simple, cost-effective, preserves bioreceptor activity, and requires no modi\ufb01cation of biological elements or matrix generation. However, it is sensitive to changes in pH, tem- perature, and ionic strength due to its reliance on weak interactions, which can affect operational and storage stability. Biorecognition elements are typically embedded within the three-dimensional network of organic or inorganic materials. Organic materials include polydimethylsiloxane, photopolymers,", "teractions, which can affect operational and storage stability. Biorecognition elements are typically embedded within the three-dimensional network of organic or inorganic materials. Organic materials include polydimethylsiloxane, photopolymers,", "gelatin, alginate, cellulose, acetate phthalate, modi\ufb01ed polypropyl- ene, and polyacrylamide. Inorganic materials such as activated car- bon and porous ceramic materials are also used. Common techniques for immobilization include electro polymerization, the sol-gel process, and microencapsulation. 240 Disha Pant et al. Electro polymerization involves applying current or potential to an aqueous solution or electrolyte containing biomolecules and monomers. This leads to either reduction or oxidation of the monomer on the electrode surface, forming reactive radicals that polymerize and trap enzymes near the electrode in the solution. Commonly used electropolymerized \ufb01lms include aniline, pyrrole, and thiophene. The sol-gel process is widely employed for enzyme entrapment, involving the hydrolysis and condensation of metal alkoxides at low temperatures. This results in the formation of a nanoporous mate- rial network that encapsulates biomolecules under mild conditions, offering thermal and chemical stability and ease of synthesis. Microencapsulation is another economical method where enzymes are enclosed within a spherical semi-permeable mem- brane. This membrane can be made from polymeric, lipoidal, lipoprotein-based, or non-ionic materials. Two preferred microen- capsulation techniques are phase separation (coacervation) of enzyme micro-droplets in water-immiscible liquid phases and inter- facial polymerization at the interface of immiscible substances. These techniques effectively encapsulate enzymes within a poly- meric membrane, ensuring their protection and functionality [30\u2013 33]. Chemical or irreversible immobilization involves creating robust chemical bonds, such as covalent binding or cross-linking, between functional groups of the biorecognition element and the t", "brane, ensuring their protection and functionality [30\u2013 33]. Chemical or irreversible immobilization involves creating robust chemical bonds, such as covalent binding or cross-linking, between functional groups of the biorecognition element and the transducer surface. Chemical immobilization methods are classi\ufb01ed into direct covalent binding and covalent cross-linking. Direct Covalent Binding: Direct covalent binding is the pre- dominant technique for enzyme immobilization, where the bior- ecognition element forms strong bonds with either the electrode/ transducer surface or an inert matrix in a membrane. The process involves two main steps: synthesis of a functional polymer and subsequent covalent immobilization. This binding relies on inter- actions between functional groups of the biorecognition element (typically amino acid side chains) and reactive groups on the trans- ducer or membrane matrix surface. Advantages of direct covalent binding include high resistance to environmental \ufb02uctuations, minimal leakage of enzymes, and robust bonding between the biorecognition element and the matrix. Drawbacks include the use of harsh chemicals and irrever- sibility once the matrix is used.", "Biosensor-Based Drug Delivery Systems: Innovations, Applications, and\u2026 241 Covalent Cross-Linking: Covalent cross-linking involves creat- ing intermolecular covalent bonds between biorecognition ele- ments (enzymes) or between biorecognition elements and inert proteins (e.g., bovine serum albumin). This process utilizes multi- functional reagents as linkers to connect enzyme molecules into 3D cross-linked structures anchored to the transducer surface. Optimal conditions for cross-linking include pH, temperature, and ionic strength adjustments. Bene\ufb01ts of covalent cross-linking include reduced enzyme leak- age, strong chemical bonds, and the ability to optimize the envi- ronment for biorecognition elements using stabilizing agents. However, drawbacks include potential cross-linking between pro- tein molecules rather than with the matrix, which can lead to partial protein denaturation and limit application versatility [30\u201333]. 3.1.3 Selection of Transducer Electrochemical biosensors rely on the electrochemical properties of the analyte and transducer. Electrochemical biosensors are extensively researched and uti- lized, leveraging the electrochemical properties of both the analyte and the transducer for operation. Renowned for their high sensi- tivity, selectivity, and detection capabilities, they operate through electrochemical reactions occurring at the transducer surface between the bioreceptor and analyte. These reactions produce discernible electrochemical signals, including voltage, current, impedance, and capacitance. Electrochemical biosensors are classi- \ufb01ed based on their transduction principles into potentiometric, amperometric, impedimetric, conductometric, and voltammetric types [34\u201336]. Potentiometric biosensors detect charge accumulation from the interactio", "lectrochemical biosensors are classi- \ufb01ed based on their transduction principles into potentiometric, amperometric, impedimetric, conductometric, and voltammetric types [34\u201336]. Potentiometric biosensors detect charge accumulation from the interaction between an analyte and a bioreceptor at the working electrode, measured against a reference electrode with no current \ufb02ow. They use ion-selective electrodes and ion-sensitive \ufb01eld-effect transistors to convert biochemical reactions into potential signals. Amperometric biosensors, operating in two or three-electrode con\ufb01gurations, measure current from electrochemical reactions at the working electrode under a constant potential, providing a sensitive, fast, precise, and linear response proportional to analyte concentration. Despite these advantages, they suffer from poor selectivity and interference from other electroactive substances. Conductometric biosensors measure changes in conductance between electrode pairs due to electrochemical reactions in the analyte, often used alongside impedimetric biosensors to monitor metabolic processes in living systems. Impedimetric biosensors measure electrical impedance at the electrode/electrolyte interface using a small sinusoidal excitation signal and analyzing the in/out-of-phase current response as a function of frequency. This technique involves applying low ampli- tude AC voltage at the sensor electrode and measuring the resulting current with an impedance analyzer.", "242 Disha Pant et al. Voltammetric biosensors detect analytes by measuring the cur- rent during controlled variations of the applied potential, offering highly sensitive measurements and the capability for simultaneous detection of multiple analytes. Optical biosensors are analytical instruments that combine a biorecognition element with an optical transducer system. They operate by producing signals directly proportional to the analyte concentration, offering real-time and label-free detection in paral- lel. These biosensors employ various biorecognition elements, such as enzymes, antibodies, aptamers, whole cells, and tissues. Within optical biosensors, the transduction process leads to modi\ufb01cations in absorption, transmission, re\ufb02ection, refraction, phase, ampli- tude, frequency, and/or light polarization. These alterations arise in response to physical or chemical changes initiated by the bior- ecognition elements [34\u201336] The most commonly used optical-based biosensors are \ufb02uorescence-based optical biosensors, chemiluminescence-based optical biosensors, SPR-based optical biosensors, and optical \ufb01ber-based optical biosensors [30]. Fluorescence-based optical biosensors utilize \ufb02uorescence labeling to detect analytes or molecules. These biosensors are highly valued for medical diagnosis, environmental monitoring, and food quality assessment due to their high selectivity, sensitivity, and quick response time. Various \ufb02uorescent dyes, such as quantum dots, traditional dyes, and \ufb02uorescent proteins, are employed. Fluorescence-based biosensors operate through \ufb02uorescent quenching (turn-off), \ufb02uorescent enhancement (turn-on), and \ufb02uorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). FRET-based optical biosensors, noted for their higher sensitiv- ity, are particularly prominent in s", "based biosensors operate through \ufb02uorescent quenching (turn-off), \ufb02uorescent enhancement (turn-on), and \ufb02uorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). FRET-based optical biosensors, noted for their higher sensitiv- ity, are particularly prominent in studying intercellular processes, detecting changes on the scale of angstroms to nanometers. They are extensively used in clinical applications like cancer therapy and aptamer analysis. A FRET sensor is based on a carbon dots (CDs)/ Au NR assembly to detect lead ions, achieving a linear detection range from 0 to 155 \u03bcM with a detection limit of 0.05 \u03bcM [30]. Chemiluminescence-based optical biosensors, which emit light as a result of chemical reactions, are highly valued for their simplic- ity, low detection limits, wide calibration ranges, and cost-effective instrumentation. Recent advancements have incorporated nanoma- terials to enhance intrinsic sensitivity and broaden application areas. A chemiluminescence-based biosensor using graphene oxide can detect DNA, demonstrating high sensitivity and selectivity with a linear range of 0.1\u20133 nM and a detection limit of 34 pM [30]. SPR-based biosensors detect changes in the refractive index due to molecular interactions at a metal surface via surface plasmon waves, functioning as a label-free biosensing technology. When polarized light illuminates a metal surface at the interface of two media with different refractive indices, it generates electron charge", "density waves (plasmons) at a speci\ufb01c angle, reducing the intensity of the re\ufb02ected light, which correlates with the mass on the surface. This principle is used for various applications, including disease diagnosis and environmental and food quality monitoring. Extend- ing SPR to metal-based nanomaterials like gold and silver nanopar- ticles results in localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), where plasma oscillations occur locally at the nanostructure surface. Rashidi et al. developed an SPR-based DNA biosensor using gold nanostars to detect a donkey meat marker, achieving a detection limit of 1.0 nM with a relative standard deviation of 0.85%. Biosensor-Based Drug Delivery Systems: Innovations, Applications, and\u2026 243 Optical \ufb01ber-based biosensors use an optical \ufb01eld to measure biological species such as whole cells, proteins, and aptamers, providing a promising alternative to traditional biomolecule assess- ment methods. These sensors often employ evanescent \ufb01eld sens- ing, which occurs in tapered optical \ufb01bers. When light passes through the \ufb01ber, an evanescent wave is generated at the sample interface due to total internal re\ufb02ection, decaying exponentially with distance and capable of exciting \ufb02uorescence near the sensing surface. Tapered optical \ufb01bers are utilized with various optical transduction methods, including changes in refractive index, absorption, \ufb02uorescence, and SPR. Gravimetric biosensors operate based on changes in mass, par- ticularly in the binding material like proteins or antibodies on their surface, resulting in detectable signals. These biosensors utilize thin piezoelectric quartz crystals that vibrate at a speci\ufb01c frequency in\ufb02uenced by both the applied current and the mass of the material being detected. Piezoelectric-based biosensors, magnet", "resulting in detectable signals. These biosensors utilize thin piezoelectric quartz crystals that vibrate at a speci\ufb01c frequency in\ufb02uenced by both the applied current and the mass of the material being detected. Piezoelectric-based biosensors, magnetoelastic- based biosensors (MES), and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensors are most commonly used for gravimetric transduction. A thermal biosensor utilizes the fundamental properties of biological reactions, such as whether they are exothermic or endo- thermic, by measuring the heat energy absorbed or released during the reaction. The total heat energy absorbed or evolved, or the resulting temperature change (\u0394T) detected by the thermal biosen- sor, is directly proportional to the enthalpy (\u0394H) and the total number of product molecules (np) generated in the biochemical reaction. Conversely, it is inversely proportional to the heat capacity (Cp) of the reaction, expressed as \u0394T = -(np \u0394H) / Cp. Acoustic biosensors function by detecting alterations in the physical characteristics of an acoustic wave, which can be linked to the quantity of absorbed analyte. Piezoelectric materials are fre- quently employed as sensor transducers due to their capability to generate and propagate acoustic waves in a frequency-dependent fashion. In the propagation of acoustic waves, the ideal resonant frequency is greatly in\ufb02uenced by the physical dimensions and attributes of the piezoelectric crystal. Changes in the mass of mate- rials on the crystal\u2019s surface can lead to observable \ufb02uctuations in the crystal\u2019s natural resonant frequency.", "n the crystal\u2019s natural resonant frequency.", "244 Disha Pant et al. 3.2 Green Biosensors Herbal extracts have garnered signi\ufb01cant interest in biosensor- based drug delivery systems due to their unique biochemical prop- erties and potential therapeutic bene\ufb01ts. These natural extracts, derived from plants with medicinal properties, are rich sources of bioactive compounds such as polyphenols, alkaloids, and \ufb02avo- noids, which exhibit antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti- in\ufb02ammatory properties. Integrating herbal extracts into biosen- sors enables targeted and controlled drug delivery, where the bio- sensor can detect speci\ufb01c biomarkers or conditions and trigger the release of therapeutic compounds encapsulated within nanoparti- cles or hydrogels. This approach not only enhances the precision and ef\ufb01cacy of drug delivery but also leverages the biocompatibility and sustainability of herbal ingredients. Moreover, the use of herbal extracts aligns with the growing preference for natural and eco-friendly healthcare solutions, offering promising avenues for developing next-generation biosensor technologies with enhanced therapeutic potential.

Biocompatibility: Ensuring that biosensors are compatible with the human body without causing an immune response or adverse reactions is crucial. Materials used must not provoke in\ufb02ammation, infection, or toxicity over long-term implantation. 2. Biofouling: The accumulation of proteins, cells, and other biological materials on sensor surfaces can hinder sensor per- formance and accuracy. Effective strategies to prevent or mini- mize biofouling are essential to maintain sensor functionality. 3. Stability and Longevity: Biosensors need to maintain their stability and sensitivity over extended periods. This includes resistance to degradation from the physiological environment, such as varying pH levels, enzymatic activity, and mechanical stress. 4. Selective and Sensitive Detection: Biosensors must be highly selective and sensitive to speci\ufb01c biomarkers related to drug delivery and disease states. Cross-reactivity with non-target molecules and low signal-to-noise ratios can reduce the effec- tiveness of the sensor. 5. Integration with Drug Delivery Systems: Designing biosensors that can seamlessly integrate with drug delivery mechanisms is challenging. This includes synchronization of the sensor with the drug release system to ensure timely and appropriate thera- peutic interventions. 6. Miniaturization and Power Requirements: Reducing the size of biosensors to \ufb01t within implantable devices while ensuring they have adequate power sources for long-term operation is a signi\ufb01cant challenge. Energy-ef\ufb01cient designs and alternative power sources like bi", " and Power Requirements: Reducing the size of biosensors to \ufb01t within implantable devices while ensuring they have adequate power sources for long-term operation is a signi\ufb01cant challenge. Energy-ef\ufb01cient designs and alternative power sources like bio-batteries or wireless power transfer need to be considered. 7. Data Transmission and Security: Ensuring reliable transmission of data from the biosensor to external monitoring systems, often wirelessly, is critical. Data security and privacy concerns must also be addressed to protect patient information. 8. Calibration and Maintenance: Developing biosensors that require minimal calibration and maintenance over their opera- tional life is important for practical and widespread use. Auto- mated or self-calibrating systems can help address this issue. 9. Regulatory and Ethical Considerations: Biosensors for drug delivery must comply with stringent regulatory standards and undergo extensive testing to ensure safety and ef\ufb01cacy. Ethical considerations, particularly regarding patient consent and data handling, must also be addressed.", "246 Disha Pant et al. 10. Cost and Scalability: Producing biosensors that are cost- effective and scalable for mass production without compromis- ing quality is a key challenge. Economic viability is crucial for widespread adoption in clinical settings. Addressing these challenges requires interdisciplinary research and collaboration among materials scientists, engineers, biologists, and medical professionals to develop robust and reliable biosensors for drug delivery applications. 4 Future Perspectives: Can Arti\ufb01cial Intelligence Be a Boon in Biosensor-Based Drug Delivery Systems AI-based computer modeling offers a cost-effective alternative to traditional laboratory methods, which can be labor-intensive and slow. Utilizing machine-based intelligence, AI performs complex analytical tasks using computers or computer-controlled robots, surpassing the capabilities of human-based natural intelligence. AI and its sub\ufb01elds can simulate biological processes related to gene delivery with high precision, evaluate the effectiveness of gene/ drug delivery vehicles, control gene/drug delivery parameters, and model cells and their intracellular organelles to develop highly ef\ufb01cient and non-toxic gene delivery agents. AI encompasses machine learning (ML), neural networks (NNs), expert systems, deep learning (DL), computer vision, robotics, and reinforcement learning. Recent advancements in nanobiomedicine have presented a major challenge for scientists: the binding of cellular and humoral components such as apolipoproteins, immune proteins, or comple- ment components to nanomedicine after injection into the blood- stream. This protein binding, known as the protein corona (PC), affects the physicochemical properties, reactivity, immune response, stability, macrophage uptake, cellular", "ns, or comple- ment components to nanomedicine after injection into the blood- stream. This protein binding, known as the protein corona (PC), affects the physicochemical properties, reactivity, immune response, stability, macrophage uptake, cellular recognition, and fate of nano- carriers. Predicting protein corona formation is challenging due to the complexities of nanomaterial properties, reaction conditions, and extracellular protein composition. However, machine learning can accurately and quantitatively predict the functional composi- tion of the protein corona and cellular responses (such as cytokine release and macrophage uptake). Machine learning algorithms, such as random forest, can predict protein corona formation by analyzing nanomaterial descriptors like size, surface charge, and \ufb02uorescence properties. For instance, the formation of a protein corona on silver nanoparticles can be predicted using a machine learning algorithm based on a random forest, which combines solution conditions with the physicochemical characteristics of proteins and nanoparticles to provide accurate predictions. Addi- tionally, ML-based approaches, including support vector machines,", "multivariate adaptive regression splines (EARTH), partial least squares (PLS), multiple linear regression (MLR), and projection pursuit regression (PPR), have been used to predict the bioactivity of surface-modi\ufb01ed gold nanoparticles and analyze the composi- tion of the protein corona. Biosensor-Based Drug Delivery Systems: Innovations, Applications, and\u2026 247 5 Bene\ufb01ts of Arti\ufb01cial Intelligence in Development of Biosensor-Based Drug Delivery Arti\ufb01cial intelligence signi\ufb01cantly enhances the development of biosensor-based drug delivery systems by offering several key ben- e\ufb01ts. First, AI-driven models can optimize biosensor sensitivity and speci\ufb01city by analyzing vast datasets to identify patterns and corre- lations that might be missed by traditional methods. This leads to the creation of more accurate and reliable sensors. Second, AI algorithms can predict the optimal conditions for drug release, ensuring that medications are delivered at the right time and in the right amounts, improving therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy and minimizing side effects. Third, AI can facilitate real-time monitoring and feed- back, allowing for adaptive drug delivery that responds dynamically to changes in a patient\u2019s condition. This is particularly valuable in managing chronic diseases, where continuous monitoring and timely interventions are crucial. Furthermore, AI can assist in the design of biosensors that are more biocompatible and resistant to biofouling, extending their lifespan and functionality in vivo. Over- all, the integration of AI into biosensor-based drug delivery systems holds the promise of more personalized, ef\ufb01cient, and effective healthcare solutions. References 1.

Conventional routes for ocular drug delivery include topical, subconjunctival, intracameral, intravitreal, transscleral, retrobulbar, and systemic. Among them, topical route is one of the preferred routes due to its non-invasiveness, safety, and high patient compliance. However, presence of various anatomical and physiological ocular barriers creates hindrance in active absorption and activity of therapeutic drugs to treat ocular diseases by any route. To overcome various ocular barriers and improve drug bioavailability, development of nanotechnology- based ocular drug delivery system (ODDS) is advantageous. Ocular treatment is achieving the higher level with several advantages due to advancement in nanocarriers. Nanostructured platforms have several positive outcomes, including overcoming ocular barriers, increasing transcorneal permeability, lengthening drug residence time, reducing drug degradation, decreasing dosing frequency, achieving sustained release, improving patient compliance, drug targeting, and gene delivery. Many nanocarriers, such as nanoparticles, nanosuspensions, nanomicelles, nano\ufb01bers, nanoemulsions, liposomes, etc., have proven excellent delivery potential in both in-vitro and in-vivo studies, enhancing drug permeability across the ocular barriers and increasing drug bioavailability in the eye.

Eye is the only organ to directly observe nervous system (optic nerve) and peripheral vasculature (retinal arterioles and venules) and thus is helpful in diagnosing various systemic diseases [1]. Complicated anatomy and physiology offer eye with challenges for drug delivery to targeted sites. Anatomically, it is divided into anterior and poste- rior segments [2]. Both segments of eye are vulnerable to a variety of diseases either due to local cause or systemic problems, causing Abhishek Pathak and Satya Pal Singh (eds.), Next-Generation Drug Delivery Systems, Methods in Pharmacology and Toxicology, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-4554-3_12, \u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025 251", "visual impairment. Structurally and functionally, ophthalmic tissues are protected by certain dynamic and static protective barriers [3]. These barriers are precorneal barriers, corneal barrier and blood-ocular barriers. Tear \ufb01lm, re\ufb02ex blinking, eyelid, conjunctiva, cornea, and nasolacrimal drainage prevent the eye surface from foreign substances [4]. Blood-ocular barriers include the blood- aqueous barrier (BAB) in the anterior segment and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) in the posterior segment of eye that prevent the to- and-fro movement of etiological agents between eye and blood circulation [5]. Although eye has multiple protective mechanisms, it is still vulnerable to infection, trauma, and other diseases. Cata- ract, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, keratitis, uveitis, etc. can cause vision impairment, and their adequate treatment is of utmost importance to improve quality of life [6]. Medicinal treatment is the primary treatment for most of eye diseases. Delivering drugs to target eye tissues at the desired therapeutic concentration without affecting other unaffected tissues is of prime concern [7]. Besides, protective barriers, which are considered as boon for eye protection on one hand, serve as hindrance in ocular therapy on the other hand. 252 Anuradha Nema To achieve therapeutic effects, medications are either applied topically, delivered subconjunctivaly, intraocularly (intracameral or intravitreal), periocularly (subtenon, retrobulbar, or juxtascleral), or systemically [8]. Ocular barriers create a substantial challenge in treating ocular problems in relation to attainment at the desired site and residing there for an appropriate duration. As a consequence, bioavailability of medications is often less than 5% [9]. For an effective therapeutics, ocular drug de", "llenge in treating ocular problems in relation to attainment at the desired site and residing there for an appropriate duration. As a consequence, bioavailability of medications is often less than 5% [9]. For an effective therapeutics, ocular drug delivery systems (ODDS) are designed so as to: (a) deliver drugs to target ocular tissues by overcoming ocular barriers, (b) enhance drug stability and treatment ef\ufb01ciency, (c) lengthen drug retention time and decrease dosing frequency, (d) facilitate multiple drug combina- tions, and (e) increase patient compliance and diminish drug- related side effects [10]. Ocular medications used are either in liquid (drops, suspen- sion, and emulsion), solid (powder, insert, contact lens), semi-solid (gels and ointments), or mixed (in-situ gel) form. Among all, eye drops are the commonest form of medications used. But they are limited mostly to deliver the medications into the anterior part of eye and have short residence time [11]. For a drug to be effective, it must reach and preserve an acceptable drug concentration with minimum quantity of active therapeutic component. It is achieved by appropriate corneal penetration along with effective precorneal residence time. To overcome all ocular therapeutic challenges, innovative nanotechnology is evidencing dynamic progress in the \ufb01eld of ocular drug delivery. These technologies are providing new ophthalmic therapeutic interferences by overcoming ocular obsta- cles, reducing drug degradation, increasing drug residence time,", "enhancing trans-corneal permeation across barriers, and reducing dosing frequency. Nanosystems with numerous advantages are to the next level as compared to traditional drug administration by improving patient compliance, achieving sustained and controlled release, drug targeting, and gene delivery [12]. Nanocarriers, such as nanoemulsions (NEs), nanomicelles, microemulsions, nanopar- ticles (NPs), nano\ufb01bers, dendrimers, liposomes, nanowafers, microneedles (MNs), etc., are effective in therapy of anterior and posterior ocular diseases. Gene therapy, exosome, and self-nano- emulsifying drug delivery systems (SNEDDS) are emerging as potential tools in ocular drug delivery [13]. Hence, for effective ophthalmic treatment, a novel non-invasive ODDS is important to overcome ocular barriers, sustained drug release, and its maintained effective drug concentrations at the targeted site. Ocular Drug Delivery: Overcoming Barriers for Effective Treatment 253 2 Eye\u2019s Anatomy Anatomically eye is divided into anterior and posterior segments. Anterior segment includes tear \ufb01lm, cornea, pupil, conjunctiva, iris, ciliary body, aqueous humor, and lens, while the posterior segment is composed of sclera, choroid, vitreous body, retina, and optic nerve. Anatomy of eye is demonstrated in Fig. 1. Quantity and Fig. 1 Anatomy of the eye.

Cornea is composed of \ufb01ve layers, epithelium, bowman\u2019s membrane, stroma, descemet\u2019s membrane, and endothelium. It is known as a lipid- aqueous-lipid sandwich, where stroma (hydrophilic) is sandwiched between epithelium and endothelium. Transparency of cornea is preserved by endothelium [5]. Conjunctiva, a delicate transparent mucous membrane, is divided into palpebral and bulbar conjunc- tiva. It is composed of epithelium, substantia propria enclosing nerves, lymphatic and blood vessels, and submucosa layer. Iris, the pigmented portion of eye, regulates the quantity of light penetrating the eye through control of pupil size. Ciliary body is composed of pigmented and non-pigmented epithelium, stroma, and muscles. Capillaries of ciliary body is responsible for communi- cation between anterior and posterior segments. Transparent lens focuses the light onto retina. Vitreous humor, a gel-like, clear, avascular tissue, maintains the shape of eye. It is made of 99.9% water, hyaluronic acid, and collagen. Sclera is made of collagen and mucopolysaccharides. Choroid, situated between sclera and retina, is a vascular layer. The retina is composed of neural and glial cells that produces electrical impulses and deliver them via optic nerve to brain [11]. 254 Anuradha Nema 3 Ocular Barriers Hindering Absorption of Drugs Static and dynamic absorption barriers in eye prevent extraneous substances, including therapeutic agents, from reaching to targeted sites. Dynamic barriers principally include tear \ufb01lm, tear turnover, nasolacrimal duct drainage, conjunctival and choroidal blood \ufb02ow, and lymphatic clearance. Cornea, conjunctiva, sclera, vitreous body, BAB, and BRB form static barriers of eye. Barriers can also be stated as precorne", " include tear \ufb01lm, tear turnover, nasolacrimal duct drainage, conjunctival and choroidal blood \ufb02ow, and lymphatic clearance. Cornea, conjunctiva, sclera, vitreous body, BAB, and BRB form static barriers of eye. Barriers can also be stated as precorneal, corneal, and blood-ocular barriers. Various ocular barriers are depicted in Fig. 2. All barriers limit absorption of various ocular therapeutic drugs, thereby reducing their bioavailability [14]. 3.1 Precorneal Barriers Tear \ufb01lm, eyelids and their re\ufb02ex blinking, conjunctiva, and naso- lacrimal drainage prevent foreign substances away from the eye surface. It prevents drugs from reaching the cornea and other ocular tissues. Variations in capacity of cul-de-sac also affects thera- peutic drug concentration in eye. 3.1.1 Tear Film, Tear Turnover, and Nasolacrimal Duct Drainage A thin, transparent tear \ufb01lm is composed of an outer lipid layer, middle aqueous layer, and inner mucin layer. Negatively charged mucin layer protect the eye surface from harmful molecules and infections through electrostatic forces. The aqueous and lipid layers act as barriers for lipophilic and lipophobic drugs, respectively [15]. The non-speci\ufb01c binding of drugs to tear enzymes and", "proteins also obstruct drug absorption and entry through cornea and anterior chamber. Additionally, after topical application of drugs tear turnover increases, resulting in rapid removal of drug through nasolacrimal drainage (1\u20132 minutes). This drainage is a major barrier in the precorneal region [16]. In view of maintaining effective drug concentration, residence time of the drug must be attained by different mechanisms. Ocular Drug Delivery: Overcoming Barriers for Effective Treatment 255 Fig. 2 Ocular barriers 3.1.2 Capacity of Cul-de- sac Cul-de-sac, a shallow pocket in the lower eyelid where palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva meet, has a maximum capacity of approxi- mately 30 \u03bcL [17]. In in\ufb02ammatory and allergic conditions of eye, capacity of cul-de-sac is further minimized. The low capacity of cul- de-sac reduces the residence time and concentration of the drug in eye, thereby reducing its therapeutic effects. 3.1.3 Conjunctival and Scleral Barriers After topical administration, the non-corneal alternative route of drug entry is through conjunctiva and sclera. Conjunctival mucous membrane is formed by epithelium and stromal layer. It produces and maintains tear \ufb01lm and protects the eye from external patho- gens. Conjunctival surface area is approximately 17 times greater than that of cornea. Hence, it is more permeable than the cornea for absorption of macromolecules and hydrophilic compounds [18]. Additionally, being highly vascularized medicines remain localized for shorter duration and systemically absorbed to be distributed throughout the body. This non-productive huge drug loss into the systemic circulation reduces ocular region bioavailabil- ity. To overcome this loss and to enhance drug ef\ufb01cacy, high", "ributed throughout the body. This non-productive huge drug loss into the systemic circulation reduces ocular region bioavailabil- ity. To overcome this loss and to enhance drug ef\ufb01cacy, high", "concentrations with repeated instillations of drug are required [19]. However, in this way, patient compliance is negatively in\ufb02u- enced and possibility of side effects is increased. 256 Anuradha Nema After permeation from conjunctiva, drug travels through trans- scleral route from sclera to anterior segment. Sclera, the white part of eye is an opaque, hard sheath and is relatively more permeable with larger surface area than cornea. The scleral penetration of drug is mainly determined by the size of drug and scleral thickness. Drug spread across the sclera through perivascular space and between scleral \ufb01brils, to reach the choroid and retina [20]. 3.2 Corneal Barrier Cornea, the outermost clear, avascular layer, protects eye from diverse chemical and mechanical injuries. It is composed of epithe- lium, stroma, and endothelium and poses a signi\ufb01cant challenge for ocular rug delivery. Only small and lipophilic drugs can pass through epithelium, whereas stroma permits hydrophilic drugs. Besides, the presence of cytochrome P450 (drug-degrading enzymes) and drug ef\ufb02ux pumps in epithelium are responsible for low drug bioavailability. Endothelium, due to its hydrophobic nature, restricts the penetration of hydrophilic drug and macro- molecules into aqueous humor. Thus, trans-corneal permeation is rate-limiting step for drug transfer from lacrimal \ufb02uid into aqueous humor that depends on drug molecular weight, hydrophobicity charge, and degree of ionization [21]. 3.3 Blood-Ocular Barriers These barriers prevent the non-speci\ufb01c entry of foreign compounds into the blood stream and are classi\ufb01ed as blood-aqueous barrier (BAB) in anterior segment and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) in posterior segment of eye. Additionally, they limit the entry of compounds into the eye from systemic c", " of foreign compounds into the blood stream and are classi\ufb01ed as blood-aqueous barrier (BAB) in anterior segment and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) in posterior segment of eye. Additionally, they limit the entry of compounds into the eye from systemic circulation. The blood- aqueous barrier consists of non-pigmented ciliary body of iris vas- culature and epithelial tissue of the endothelial cells. The perme- ability of drugs across BAB is determined by the osmotic pressure and physicochemical properties of therapeutic agents. Lipophilic and small-molecule drugs can permeate more rapidly through bar- rier than hydrophilic and large-molecule drugs. This specialized tissue barrier creates a challenge for ocular drug delivery and hin- ders therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy [22]. The blood-retinal barrier is the most important barrier in pos- terior part of eye and comprises of internal and external compo- nents. The inner BRB is formed by tight junctions between retinal capillary endothelial cells, while close junctions between retinal pigment epithelial cells forms outer BRB. It prevents entry of plasma components, drugs, and toxic substances into retina. Hence, BRB is essential to maintain normal visual function [23].", "Ocular Drug Delivery: Overcoming Barriers for Effective Treatment 257 4 Various Routes for Ocular Drug Delivery Conventional routes of ocular drug administration primarily include topical, conjunctival and scleral, intracameral, intravitreal, retrobulbar, and systemic routes. Figure 3 demonstrates various routes for ocular drug delivery. Table 1 summarizes various routes of ocular drug administration with their advantages, challenges encountered, and applications. Drug administration done by any route has to bypass one or more ocular barriers to reach the targeted site. Table 2 demonstrates some common ocular drugs with their preferred route of administration and uses. 4.1 Topical Administration Topical administration is the commonest and easiest non-invasive route of ocular drug administration. It represents more than 95% of commercially available ocular products but with low bioavailability (<5%). As compared to other routes of administration, it has the advantages of (a) being non-invasive, (b) relative ease of drug administration, and (c) minimum systemic side effects of drug. Hence, ophthalmic solutions are the foremost choice for many anterior segment eye diseases management, such as dry eye, in\ufb02am- mation, infection, allergy, and glaucoma [24]. But, due to insuf\ufb01- cient corneal permeation and short residence time, bioavailability is low. Furthermore, bioavailability is reduced by tear drainage, re\ufb02ex blinking, and non-productive absorption to systemic circulation through conjunctiva and nasolacrimal region. To overcome this Fig. 3 Routes for ocular drug delivery.

Therefore, to improve ocular bioavailability, newer approaches, viz. nanocarriers, collagen corneal shields, contact lenses, etc., are explored to increase the pre-corneal retention time, increase stability, and enhance the corneal, scleral, or conjunctival permeability [26].

It is an effective route to deliver drugs to treat diseases of anterior segment of eye, such as uveitis, corneal opacity, etc. This route is commonly used in cases of very low drug permeation into the anterior part of eye after topical administration. However, drug loss due to blood and lymphatic drainage through the conjunctiva occurs by this route [28]. 4.3 Transscleral Administration It is a simple, minimally invasive, and more appropriate method for treatment of posterior segment diseases, such as trauma or diabetic- related conditions, that are not manageable through conventional topical route. This route bypasses the obstacles in anterior segment of eye. Molecules up to 70 kDa can easily in\ufb01ltrate the sclera, which are otherwise impermeable to cornea. Besides, large sur", "onditions, that are not manageable through conventional topical route. This route bypasses the obstacles in anterior segment of eye. Molecules up to 70 kDa can easily in\ufb01ltrate the sclera, which are otherwise impermeable to cornea. Besides, large surface area of sclera (about 95% of total surface area of eye) helps in delivering antioxidants, neuro-protective agents, or anti-angiogenic agents to targeted sites in retina [29]. Nevertheless, intraocular drug bio- availability by this method is lower than direct intravitreal injection route due to certain dynamic barriers. 4.4 Intracameral Administration Intracameral administration involves relatively easy and ef\ufb01cient drug delivery directly into the anterior chamber. Direct drug deliv- ery by this method avoids barriers of cornea, conjunctiva, and BAB, as well as decreases the side effects and \ufb01rst-pass metabolism of some systemic agents. It is used for prophylactic antibiotics or anesthetics associated with eye surgeries, especially subsequent to cataract surgery to avoid endophthalmitis [30].

However, due to vitreous \ufb02uid turnover, free drugs are removed quickly. Hence, to achieve good therapeutic results, frequent IVIs are required, resulting into adverse effects such as endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, and elevated intraocular pressure. Therefore, to maintain therapeutic effects, delay treatment intervals, and pro- tect normal ocular tissues, safer and more ef\ufb01cient alternatives, such as nanocarriers, intravitreal implants, and hydrogels, are required to combat ocular diseases [32]. A new approach for treatment of glaucoma includes a single intravitreal injection of vitamin E/poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid microspheres enclosing glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor [33]. 4.6 Retrobulbar Administration Through this route drugs are delivered in retrobulbar space by passing needle through eyelid and orbital fascia [34].

This route is bene\ufb01cial in administering drug in depot form. Retrobulbar injec- tion of triamcinolone acetonide is used to treat condition caused by retinal vein occlusion [35]. Retrobulbar injection of amphotericin B has higher antifungal ef\ufb01cacy than intravenous injection [36].", "262 Anuradha Nema 4.7 Systemic Administration Parenteral and oral dosing as systemic administration is an alterna- tive method of ocular drug delivery. Antibiotics, anti-in\ufb02ammatory, and anti-glaucomatous drugs are given by this method to treat diseases such as uveitis, elevated intraocular pressure, and endophthalmitis [37]. However, due to the ocular barriers, only 1\u20132% of drug reaches retinal and vitreous area. Hence, to obtain the desired therapeutic effect, frequent administrations are essential, resulting into systemic side effects and poor patient compliance [38]. Therefore, it is not considered an ideal mode of drug administration. 5 Nanotechnology-Based Ocular Drug Delivery Platforms To improve drug bioavailability by overcoming various ocular bar- riers, the development of nanotechnology-based ocular drug deliv- ery system (ODDS) is a boon. Advancement in nanocarriers has taken ocular treatment to the next level with several advantages, including overcoming ocular barriers, increasing transcorneal per- meability, lengthening drug residence time, reducing drug degra- dation, decreasing dosing frequency, improving patient compliance, attaining sustained/controlled release, drug targeting, and gene delivery. Many nanocarriers such as nanoparticles, nano- micelles, nanosuspensions, nanoemulsions, nano\ufb01bers, dendri- mers, niosomes, liposomes, nanowafers, etc. have proven superb delivery potential in both in-vitro and in-vivo studies, enhancing drug permeability across the ocular barriers and increasing drug bioavailability in the eye [39]. Nanotechnology-based various ocu- lar drug delivery systems (ODDSs) are depicted in Fig. 4. Table 3 exempli\ufb01es some nanotechnology-based ocular drugs with their characteristics. 5.1 Nanoparticles (NPs) NPs are colloidal drug carr", "ity in the eye [39]. Nanotechnology-based various ocu- lar drug delivery systems (ODDSs) are depicted in Fig. 4. Table 3 exempli\ufb01es some nanotechnology-based ocular drugs with their characteristics. 5.1 Nanoparticles (NPs) NPs are colloidal drug carriers with ideal sizes ranging from 10 to 100 nm. They are mainly divided into polymer and lipid NPs [40]. The effective ocular absorption of NPs depends on surface charge that can be either positive or negative. Cationic NPs have a higher retention time on the corneal and conjunctival negatively charged surfaces than anionic NPs. Presently, NPs are widely used for targeted drug delivery in eye, with advantages of smaller size and less irritation, non-speci\ufb01c uptake or premature degradation avoidance, sustained drug release to avoid repeated dosing, better absorption and increased intracellular permeation, and targeted delivery to desired tissues [41]. 5.1.1 Polymeric Nanoparticles (PNPs) Polymeric nanoparticles used in ocular preparations are composed of natural or synthetic polymers such as sodium alginate, chitosan, polylactide-coglycolide (PLGA), polylactic acid (PLA), and poly- caprolactone (PCL). Among all, PLGA is widely accepted due to its", "excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, and capacity to modu- late drug release by altering terminal groups, molecular weight, and lactide-to-glycoside ratio [ ]. As per their structure, these are classi\ufb01ed as nanospheres and nanocapsules. Nanospheres are small solid spheres composed of a dense polymeric matrix type network with a large surface area. Nanocapsules are composed of a poly- meric membrane with small liquid core. In both types, drug is either adsorbed on the surface or entrapped in-situ. Polymeric nanoparticles have an approach to both the segments of eye [ ]. Patient compliance is improved due to their small particle size, prolonged drug release, improved permeation, and reduced elimination rate [ ]. Polymeric nanoparticles for dexamethasone utilizing glycol chitosan, N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N\u2032- -ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride, and N-hydroxysuccinimide have small particle size, enhanced retention time, and sustained release [ ]. Ef\ufb01cacy and sustained release of lutein are enhanced with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), tween 80, and Poloxamer 407 [ ]. Enhanced ef\ufb01cacy and ocular permeation of acetazol- \u00ae amide using chitosan, Tween 80/20, span 60, and sodium tripo- lyphosphate are seen [ ]. Subconjunctival injection of chitosan- coated polylactide-glycolic acid NPs (CS-PLGA NPs) has better permeability that delivers Bev (anti-VEGF drug) with higher con- centrations (above 22 ng/mL for 6 weeks) for 12 weeks in the posterior segment of eye as compared to traditional local and intravitreal injections in diabetic retinopathy cases 46 45 44 17 43 42 Ocular Drug Delivery: Overcoming Barriers for Effective Treatment 263 Fig. 4 (1) Polymeric NPs; (2) lipid NP; (3) liposome; (4) nanoemulsion; (5) nanomicelle; (6) nanocrystals; (7) nanosuspension; (8) dendrimer", "tic retinopathy cases 46 45 44 17 43 42 Ocular Drug Delivery: Overcoming Barriers for Effective Treatment 263 Fig. 4 (1) Polymeric NPs; (2) lipid NP; (3) liposome; (4) nanoemulsion; (5) nanomicelle; (6) nanocrystals; (7) nanosuspension; (8) dendrimer; (9) microneedles; (10) nano\ufb01bers; (11) nanowafer; (12) niosome; (13) hydrogel", "264 Anuradha Nema Table 3 Examples of various nanotechnology based ocular drugs with their characteristics Drug Nanostructured platform Additional components Characteristics Acetazolamide Polymeric nanoparticles Chitosan and span 60 Enhanced ocular permeation and ef\ufb01cacy Cyclosporine A Polymeric nanoparticles Span 80 and hyaluronic acid Increased cellular uptake and ef\ufb01cacy Dexamethasone Polymeric nanoparticles Glycol chitosan Enhanced retention time and sustained release Triamcinolone acetonide Lipid nanoparticles Pluronic\u00ae F-68 and gellan gum Improved residence time and increased delivered drug concentration Tobramycin Lipid nanoparticles Stearic acid, Epikuron 200, and sodium taurocholate Higher concentration in both segments of eye Cyclosporine A Nanomicelles Hyaluronic acid Improved and sustained release and permeation Tacrolimus Nanomicelles Amino lactic acid and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose Enhanced ocular permeation and prolonged release Pimecrolimus Nanomicelles Polyethylene glycol and poly (\u03b5-caprolactone) Sustained release and enhanced activity Cyclosporine A Nanoemulsions Chitosan, Carbopol\u00ae , and Transcutol\u00ae P Enhanced drug retention, safety, and ef\ufb01cacy Timolol Nanoemulsions Chitosan, hydroxyethylcellulose, Polyvinylalcohol, and polyethylene glycol Increased permeability and activity Terbina\ufb01ne hydrochloride Nanoemulsions Surfactants, co-surfactant, and gellan gum Sustained release and improved bioavailability Pilocarpine Nanosuspensions Eudragit\u00ae RL100 Sustained drug release and enhanced activity Diclofenac Nanosuspensions Eudragit\u00ae S100 and poloxamer 188 Prolonged drug release and increased activity Methylprednisolone acetate Nanosuspensions Eudragit\u00ae RS 100 and polyvinyl alcohol Prolonged release and enhanced activity Itraconazole Nanosuspensions Chito", "anosuspensions Eudragit\u00ae S100 and poloxamer 188 Prolonged drug release and increased activity Methylprednisolone acetate Nanosuspensions Eudragit\u00ae RS 100 and polyvinyl alcohol Prolonged release and enhanced activity Itraconazole Nanosuspensions Chitosan, lysine, and poloxamer 188 Increased corneal permeation and stability (continued)", "Table 3 [47].

A mucoadhesive solid lipid nanoparticles of tobramycin, composed of stearic acid, Epikuron 200, and sodium taurocholate, has higher concentration in both segments of the eye [52]. 266 Anuradha Nema NPs have certain limitations, i.e., insuf\ufb01cient drug loading, early drug release during storage, dif\ufb01culty in attaining homoge- neous particle dispersion, and surfactant toxicity [53]. 5.2 Nanomicelles Nanomicelles are core\u2013shell nanocarriers composed of anionic, cationic, or zwitterionic surfactants. Spherical, cylindrical, or star- shaped nanomicelles can range from 10 to 100 nm in size. They may be either positive or reverse micelles based on the core drug. Positive micelles contain hydrophobic drug within the core and hydrophilic moiety outward to increase contact with water and are used to deliver hydrophobic drugs. The opposite reverse micelles arrangement is used to encapsulate, solubilize, and deliver hydro- philic drugs [54]. The unique chemical structure of nanomicelles have simple preparation techniques, increased stability, enhanced permeation, can solubilize drugs internally, increased bioavailabil- ity, reduced adverse reactions, and have a sustained release effect. Transport of drugs to both segments of the eye makes it a safe alternative for ocular drug delivery [17]. Tacrolimus", "eation, can solubilize drugs internally, increased bioavailabil- ity, reduced adverse reactions, and have a sustained release effect. Transport of drugs to both segments of the eye makes it a safe alternative for ocular drug delivery [17]. Tacrolimus has enhanced ocular permeation and prolonged release when used with amino- terminated polyethylene glycol-block-poly(D,L)-lactic acid and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose [55]. Similarly, hyaluronic acid sus- tains the release, increases permeation, and increases the activity of cyclosporine A [56]. Cyclosporine nanomicelles loaded with tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) (approxi- mately 13 nm) and 5 mg/mL cyclosporine, facilitated drug reten- tion in cornea and sclera, and maintained good acceptance for ophthalmic applications [57]. A nano-micelle drug to deliver anti- VEGF composed of polypropylene glycol, polyethene glycol (PEG), and polycaprolactone (PCL) is superior to traditional inva- sive intravitreal injection to treat retinal diseases [58]. 5.3 Nanoemulsions (NEs) Nanoemulsion, a potential carrier for the ocular delivery ranges from 20 to 500 nm in size. On the basis of the dispersed phase system, NEs may be either (a) water-in-oil (W/O) NEs: dispersion of water droplets in oil, (b) oil-in-water (O/W) NEs: dispersion of oil droplets in water [59]. Oils in water nanoemulsions are stabi- lized by surfactants that help in interaction with corneal surface and", "enhance drug solubility. O/W NEs aids lipophilic drugs to interact with a lipid layer of tear \ufb01lm and a sustained drug release [60]. NEs as a non- invasive, cost-effective drug delivery systems are widely used for commercial production. NEs have the advantages of pro- longed anterior corneal retention time, high penetration ability, sustained drug release, and enhanced ocular bioavailability [61]. NEs have certain disadvantages, i.e., irritation of eyes, low viscosity, and thermodynamic instability. Reduced ocular tolerance and blurred vision due to high surfactant concentration and devel- opment of milky formulation may occur respectively. These draw- backs aggravate when particle size exceeds 100 nm [62]. Nanoemulsions of cyclosporine A using many oils, chitosan, Carbopol\u00ae , and Transcutol\u00ae P resulted in enhanced drug reten- tion, safety, and ef\ufb01cacy [60]. Cipro\ufb02oxacin-loaded nanoemulsion (CIP-NE) using oleic acid and Labrafac\u00ae lipophilic WL 1349 as the oil phase and Tween\u00ae 80 and Poloxamer 188 as surfactants showed increased trans-corneal permeation and sustained release [63]. Tra- voprost nanoemulsion is a novel ocular carrier that exhibits con- trolled drug release, adequate stability, enhanced safety, improved bioavailability, and sustained IOP reduction for 60 hours [64]. Thus, NEs may be promising agents for future clinical oph- thalmic applications. Ocular Drug Delivery: Overcoming Barriers for Effective Treatment 267 5.4 Nanosuspensions Nanosuspensions are submicron colloidal dispersions of lipophilic or semi-lipophilic drug nanocrystals in a dispersion medium and stabilized by surfactants or polymers. It comprises of 100% pure drug in nanometer range and is one of the most promising approaches for delivering poorly soluble active ingredients [65]. Nanosuspens", "hilic drug nanocrystals in a dispersion medium and stabilized by surfactants or polymers. It comprises of 100% pure drug in nanometer range and is one of the most promising approaches for delivering poorly soluble active ingredients [65]. Nanosuspension has no requirement of a carrier material, as in conventional matrix-framed nano-systems. It is capable of sus- tained drug release, lengthening residence time, and increased drug solubility and bioavailability. Eudragit\u00ae polymer is the most com- monly used mucoadhesive agents in preparing nanosuspensions [17]. A mucus-penetrating nanosuspension eye drops (MOX-PAM NS) comprise of an insoluble moxi\ufb02oxacin\u2013pamoate (MOX-PAM) complex. It has signi\ufb01cantly increased ocular drug absorption, improved bioavailability of moxi\ufb02oxacin hydrochloride, and had better antibacterial effects with less dosing frequency as compared to commercial formulation [66]. Thus, nanosuspension has a high clinical signi\ufb01cance in treating ocular problems. Despite these encouraging nanosuspension results, stability issues related to nanosuspensions remain unresolved. Hence, physical stability and maximum attainable particle size are crucial aspects for better effects [67]. Furthermore, nanosuspensions can also be combined with other nanotechnology. A hybrid of nanosuspension and dissolving microneedles system is effective in the delivery of hydrophobic", "drug triamcinolone acetonide (TA) via transscleral route. TA nano- suspension is incorporated into the MN array by high-speed centri- fugation to form a bilayer structure. Drug deposition by hybrid method is much higher than that of common drug-loaded MN [68]. 268 Anuradha Nema 5.5 Nanocrystals (NCs) The major con\ufb01guration of nanocrystals is the drug itself that is enclosed and stabilized by other excipients. They have simple for- mation techniques, small particle size, and high mucoadhesion properties with improved bioavailability [69]. Dexamethasone and polymyxin B nanocrystals, formed using benzalkonium chlo- ride and cetylpyridinium chloride, have small particle size, enhanced retention time, and safety [70]. Brinzolamide-loaded nanocrystals using poloxamer F68/ F127, polysorbate 80, and hydroxypropyl methycellulose have immediate dissolution with improved ef\ufb01cacy [71]. Cellulose nanocrystals of pilocarpine have sustained drug release with increased safety. Thus, nanocrystals may be promising nanocarriers for ocular rug delivery [72]. 5.6 Liposomes Liposomes are spherical nanocarriers made up of one or more concentric phospholipid bilayers with a water compartment in core. They have a diameter of 25\u20131000 nm with lipophilic drug in the lipid area, while the interior could entrap hydrophilic or lipophilic drug. Their surface charge, sensitivity to ion, pH, or temperature and particle size depend upon composition and for- mation technique [73]. Positively charged liposomes have high adherence to negatively charged cornea, longer retention time, and better absorption. This results in less dosing frequency, more safety, enhanced bioavailability, and patient satisfaction [74]. Besides, liposomes are simple to prepare and biodegradable. Positively charged liposomes of peni", "onger retention time, and better absorption. This results in less dosing frequency, more safety, enhanced bioavailability, and patient satisfaction [74]. Besides, liposomes are simple to prepare and biodegradable. Positively charged liposomes of penicillin G has fourfold increased trans-corneal \ufb02ow [75]. Liposomal system composed of phospha- tidylcholine, cholesterol, \u03b1-tocopherol, and chitosan has better corneal uptake, high percent entrapment, high drug targeting, sustained activity, and enhanced ef\ufb01cacy. Positive tacrolimus lipo- some eye drop has 300 nm diameter with surface charge of +30 mV. It interacts more with anionic eye surface with prolonged retention time and enhanced tacrolimus in the cornea for treating dry eyes. Thus, liposomes can adhere to the cornea, which are excellent carriers for drugs with low partition coef\ufb01cient, low solu- bility, high molecular weight, and poor absorption [76]. Liposomes are also extensively used in the therapy of retinal diseases. Small liposomes (~50 nm) can penetrate the retina, as compared to large liposomes (~100 nm). Additionally, anionic surface charge and PEGylation enhance retinal permeation [77]. However, limited drug loading capacity, short shelf life, and sterilization issues restrict their ophthalmic application.", "Ocular Drug Delivery: Overcoming Barriers for Effective Treatment 269 5.7 Microemulsions Microemulsions are colloidal dispersions comprised of different phases, i.e., oil phase, aqueous phase, surfactant, and cosurfactant in speci\ufb01c proportions. Droplet size in microemulsion ranges from 10 to 100 nm. Microemulsions may be either o/w (more water content) or w/o (more oil content) type emulsion. They are the most potential submicron drug carriers, particularly for poorly water-soluble drugs [78]. Microemulsions have the advantages of overcoming various ocular obstacles, reduced dosing frequency, thermodynamic stability, cost-effectiveness, and ease of prepara- tion. Thus, they are widely explored as a multiple drugs delivery vehicle to different segments of eye. Triamcinolone acetonide (TA)-loaded microemulsion with oleic acid, cremophor EL, and propylene glycol is the most effective (complete drug release within 24 hours) in uveitis. It reduces in\ufb02ammation, protein content, and in\ufb02ammatory cells compared to commercially available suspensions [79]. 5.8 Niosomes Niosomes are bilayered self-assembled vesicles composed of self- aggregated non-ionic surfactants, cholesterol, or other amphiphilic molecules. Structurally, they are similar to liposomes but have advantages of longer storage time, improved drug stability, pro- longed drug release, biodegradability, biocompatibility, and non-immunogenic [69]. They could enhance permeability and ef\ufb01cacy of both lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs. Niosomal system composed of span 60, cholesterol, poloxamer 407, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, cyclodextrin, and chitosan has high drug entrap- ment, enhanced corneal permeation, and activity with reduced side effects [80]. Improved duration of action and ef\ufb01cacy of acetazol- amide to treat ", "terol, poloxamer 407, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, cyclodextrin, and chitosan has high drug entrap- ment, enhanced corneal permeation, and activity with reduced side effects [80]. Improved duration of action and ef\ufb01cacy of acetazol- amide to treat glaucoma is seen with span 60, cholesterol, and Carbopol\u00ae 934P [81]. Niosomal gati\ufb02oxacin composed of span 60, cholesterol, and chitosan has enhanced antimicrobial activity and greater ocular permeation with no toxicity [82]. Niosomes system composed of polysorbate 60, cholesterol, and 1, 2-di-O-octadecyl-3-trimethyl- ammonium propane to deliver epalrestat drug is a good choice in diabetic patients. It encapsulates more drug (encapsulation ef\ufb01ciency 99.76%), protect premature degradation, increase solubility, and promote drug delivery to intraocular tissues (75% drug release within 20 days) with better biocompatibility as compared with contact lenses containing epal- restat or free drug solution [83]. Betaxolol-loaded niosomes mixed into pH-responsive in situ gels has a high encapsulation ef\ufb01ciency (69 \u00b1 4.8%), a negative surface charge, and a nanoscale hydrody- namic diameter to prolong precorneal drug retention. It reduces IOP with enhanced bioavailability and is promising in glaucoma treatment [84]. Similarly, latanoprost niosomes incorporated into gels resulted in more than 88% drug encapsulation ef\ufb01ciency with prolonged anti-glaucoma effect and no irritation as compared to normal latanoprost eye drops [85]. However, low drug loading,", "physical instability, encapsulated drug leakage, and high production cost are certain limitations of niosomes in ocular drug delivery [53]. 270 Anuradha Nema 5.9 Nano\ufb01bers Nano\ufb01bers are produced through electro-spinning process of nat- ural polymers (gelatin, collagen, chitosan, silk, \ufb01bronectin, and ethyl cellulose) or synthetic polymers (PLA, PLGA, and PCL) or both. Nano\ufb01bers are 1\u2013100 nm in diameter and have unique advantages of a high surface-to-volume ratio, high porosity, mod- i\ufb01able mechanical properties, high drug-loading capacity, more encapsulation ef\ufb01ciency, overcoming ocular barriers, long-term controlled drug release, and delivery of multiple drugs simulta- neously [86]. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nano\ufb01bers loaded with mel- atonin (MEL) release drug quickly (within 20 minutes) and completely with greater bioavailability to exert neuroprotective effects on retinal damage [87]. Additionally, multiple drugs can be loaded as nano\ufb01bers. Electrospun polymer \ufb01bers loaded with gentamicin and dexamethasone are immediately dissolved in the tear \ufb02uid, quantitatively releasing the two active substances to treat bacterial conjunctivitis [88]. PLGA and polyvinylpyrrolidone nano- \ufb01bers loaded with moxi\ufb02oxacin antibiotic and anti-scarring agent pirfenidone are used for the treatment of corneal abrasion. After 24 hours, pirfenidone is released from outer layer of PLGA, and about 70% of moxi\ufb02oxacin from inner layer of polyvinylpyrrolidone [89]. Dual drug-loaded nano\ufb01bers have potential in inhibiting infection as a single dose to treat corneal abrasion. This extracellular matrix-like structure is easier to prepare and less expensive than other nanostructured drug delivery systems. Additionally, to broaden application of nano\ufb01bers, it can be combined with other technologies. Nano", "at corneal abrasion. This extracellular matrix-like structure is easier to prepare and less expensive than other nanostructured drug delivery systems. Additionally, to broaden application of nano\ufb01bers, it can be combined with other technologies. Nano\ufb01bers when combined with biodegradable hydrogels for intravitreal anti-VEGF drug delivery change the pep- tide concentration to adjust the dose to treat age-related degeneration [90]. 5.10 Dendrimers Dendrimers are symmetric, tree-shaped, or star-shaped highly branched 3D nanostructure (2\u2013100 nm). They are composed of repetitive molecules enclosing a central core and several terminal groups that make them appropriate for delivery of both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs to both segments of eye [69]. Dendrimers have high capabilities of drug encapsulation and conjugation of surface groups. They have advantages of increased residence time, extended activity, enhanced bioavailability, and targeted delivery [91]. Dendrimers entrapping acetazolamide have increased resi- dence time, extended release, and increased activity to treat glau- coma [92]. Timolol maleate-loaded dendrimers utilizing polyethylene glycol have improved permeation and increased cellu- lar uptake [93]. Dendrimer-triamcinolone acetonide conjugates (D-TA) signi\ufb01cantly inhibit choroidal neovascularization (> 80%),", "i.e., 50 times better than free drug [94]. Dendrimers can be com- bined with other technologies for ocular drug delivery. Dendrimer gel particles (nDHPs), the combination of dendrimers, hydrogels, and NPs, are used to enhance ef\ufb01ciency and ef\ufb01cacy of two anti- glaucoma drugs, brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate. Com- pared with conventional drug solutions, nDHPs increase drug corneal permeability by 17 times, deliver drug precisely, and signi\ufb01- cantly lower IOP on once daily administration for 7 days [95]. Thus, dendrimers are an effective carrier for ophthalmic drug applications. However, they have disadvantages of low drug loading capacity. Ocular Drug Delivery: Overcoming Barriers for Effective Treatment 271 5.11 Nanowafers Nanowafers are small transparent disks that slowly release drugs, prolong the retention time of drugs on the ocular surface, and facilitate their absorption. Disk is applied on eye\u2019s surface with a \ufb01ngertip that remains unaffected by continuous blinks. Dexamethasone-loaded nanowafer (Dex-NW) has better ef\ufb01cacy with only two doses of Dex-NW over a 5-day treatment period to treat dry eye disease (DED) as compared to twice daily topical dexamethasone eye drops [96]. Nanowafers also act as a protective shield, protecting corneal surface damage in DED. Furthermore, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanowafers loaded with PnPP-19 (synthetic peptide with hypotensive effect on eye) pro- longs residence time, maintains its \ufb02uorescence intensity for more than 180 min., and thus has potential to treat glaucoma more ef\ufb01ciently as compared to common eye drops [97]. Thus, due to potential ef\ufb01cacy and easier application on ocular surface, nanowa- fers are promising in ophthalmic treatment. 5.12 Cubosomes Cubosomes are prepared by emulsi\ufb01cation of lipids in water usin", "\ufb01ciently as compared to common eye drops [97]. Thus, due to potential ef\ufb01cacy and easier application on ocular surface, nanowa- fers are promising in ophthalmic treatment. 5.12 Cubosomes Cubosomes are prepared by emulsi\ufb01cation of lipids in water using a stabilizer to form cubic liquid crystalline nanocarriers. They have advantages of entrapment of high number of drugs due to large surface area, easy to prepare, stability, biodegradability, and safety. Brimonidine tartrate-loaded cubosomes with glyceryl monooleate and poloxamer 407 have improved permeation, sustained release, and enhanced bioavailability and ef\ufb01cacy [98]. Beclomethasone and glyceryl monooleate cubosomal system has improved corneal per- meation and anti-in\ufb02ammatory activity [99]. 5.13 Bilosomes These are bile salts containing bilayered nanocarriers with minute particle size, high drug entrapment, safety, enhanced corneal per- meation, and activity. Terconazole-loaded bilosomes with choles- terol, span 60, has great entrapment, improved permeation, and enhanced activity [100].", "272 Anuradha Nema 5.14 Olaminosomes Olaminosomes are nanocarriers primarily composed of oleic acid and oleylamine. Oleic acid is a safe, biodegradable, and biocompat- ible natural unsaturated free fatty acid used as ocular nanocarriers [101]. Oleylamine, an unsaturated fatty amine, is extensively used as a surfactant [102]. Olaminosomes have a small particle size, high drug entrapment ability, safety, improved corneal permeation, and activity. 5.15 Contact Lenses Contact lenses that are used to correct refractive errors can be composed of either hydrophilic or hydrophobic polymers. Two main types of contact lenses for drug delivery are soft contact lenses, which are made of hydrogels or silicone polymers, and hard gas-permeable contact lenses [103]. As these drug-loaded contact lenses are in close contact with cornea, they prolong drug retention time, decrease required dose and its frequency, and improve ocular bioavailability by at least 50% with less systemic drug absorption [104]. Combination of contact lenses and nano- technology is proving bene\ufb01cial in ocular drug delivery. Immersion of contact lenses in drug-containing NPs (preferably <100 nm) is the simplest and cost-effective method of preparation. Contact lenses immersed in zinc oxide NPs (20\u201340 nm) has antibacterial activity against ocular microorganisms [105]. Additionally, contact lens can be coated with NPs containing drugs. A novel contact lens composed of polyacrylamide semi-interpenetrating network hydro- gel of quaternary ammonium chitosan and tannic acid possesses antibacterial and antioxidant properties. Besides, tannic acid works against oxidative stress and protects cells from ROS-induced cyto- toxicity and is helpful in treating ocular infectious and in\ufb02amma- tory diseases [106]. Contact lens devic", "ssesses antibacterial and antioxidant properties. Besides, tannic acid works against oxidative stress and protects cells from ROS-induced cyto- toxicity and is helpful in treating ocular infectious and in\ufb02amma- tory diseases [106]. Contact lens device with embedded drug microtubes has improved bioavailability, decreased risk of side effects and prolonged drug release time to treat glaucoma. More- over, as IOP \ufb02uctuates, it changes the curvature of contact lens, resulting in more drug release. Thus, this is an adaptive drug- release device providing dynamic and adaptive anti-glaucoma treatment [107]. 5.16 Hydrogels Hydrogels used as in-situ gels have high water retention capacity and are composed of hydrophilic polymer chains. Administered as a liquid, they transformed into a gel upon eye contact. Three main stimulation-responsive materials mostly used are heat-responsive, pH-responsive, and ion-responsive materials [108]. Hydrogels have advantages of prolonged drug retention time, sustained drug release, and co-delivery of multiple ocular drugs [109]. Combina- tion of nanotechnology and hydrogels has signi\ufb01cantly improved the therapeutic effect of ophthalmic drugs. A polypseudorotaxane hydrogel prepared by mixing Soluplus micelles (99.4 nm) with cyclodextrin solutions is bene\ufb01cial in treating anterior uveitis. This combination has improved drug retention ability (21.2", "folds), corneal permeability (1.84 folds), intraocular bioavailability (17.8 folds), sustained release, and anti-in\ufb02ammatory effect com- pared with drug solutions [110]. Thus, compounding hydrogels and nanotechnology increases ocular therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy. Ocular Drug Delivery: Overcoming Barriers for Effective Treatment 273 5.17 Microneedles (MNs) Microneedles are minimum invasive approach in treating ocular diseases. MNs used in ophthalmic applications can either be solid MNs, hollow MNs, or dissolved MNs. They have the advantages of controlled drug release, excellent ef\ufb01cacy, enhanced patient toler- ance, and cost-effective preparation [111]. A dissolved microneedle array patch based on polylactic acid (PLA) and hyaluronic acid penetrates the cornea rapidly and is ef\ufb01cient to treat fungal keratitis (FK) [112]. Additionally, controlled drug release is superior as compared to eye drops. Hence, MNs may be a safe and effective delivery method for drugs impermeable to the ocular surface. However, loading capacity, safety, bending property, and tissue damage are certain limitations to its clinical application. 6 Alternative Ocular Drug Delivery Approaches Apart from nanotechnology-based ocular drug delivery systems, other promising alternative ocular drug delivery approaches, such as gene therapy, exosomes, and SNEDDS, are depicted in Fig. 5. Fig. 5 Alternative ocular drug delivery systems", "274 Anuradha Nema 6.1 Gene Therapy Gene therapy is a novel approach to treat genetic (retinitis pigmen- tosa, retinal vascular disease, etc.) as well as non-genetic ophthalmic diseases. Gene therapy restores the function of non-functional or missing proteins either by gene editing or gene addition or knocks down proteins to block their function by gene silencing [113]. Gene therapies chie\ufb02y involve viral vectors, non-viral vectors, gene editing techniques (mainly CRISPR-Cas9), and epigenetic treat- ments with antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) and RNAi therapeutics. 6.1.1 Viral Vectors Viral vectors such as adeno-associated virus (AAV), adenovirus, lentivirus, and retrovirus are widely used in ocular gene therapy due to their high transduction competence. Viral vectors can trans- duce both dividing and nondividing cells. They do not integrate into the host cell genome but live in cells as free DNA [114]. Use of vectors could avoid repeated intravenous injections to induce a systemic blockade of VEGF-A, expressed in retina. Anti-angiogenic microRNAs are useful in the treatment of corneal neovasculariza- tion. However, drawbacks of viral vectors are potential mutagene- sis, poor immunoreactivity, limited loading capacity (< 5 kb for AAV), and high production cost, resulting in impractical approach for ocular disease treatment [115]. 6.1.2 Non-viral Vectors Non-viral vectors, such as naked DNA and peptide-based vectors, are less immunogenic, pathogenic, less expensive, and easy to man- ufacture, and have unrestricted size of genes as compared to viral vectors [116]. Redox-responsive quasi-mesoporous magnetic nanospheres (rMMNs) with an iron oxide core and disul\ufb01de bond-bridged polyethyleneimine shell loaded with miR-30a-5p upregulate the level of miR-30a-5p by targeting the t", " as compared to viral vectors [116]. Redox-responsive quasi-mesoporous magnetic nanospheres (rMMNs) with an iron oxide core and disul\ufb01de bond-bridged polyethyleneimine shell loaded with miR-30a-5p upregulate the level of miR-30a-5p by targeting the transcription factor E2F7 and inhibiting the malignant phenotype of ocular melanoma. Additionally, rMMNs play a role in the control of cancer by promoting cancer cell apoptosis by regulating M1-like macro- phage polarization and activating the Fenton reaction [117]. 6.1.3 Antisense Oligonucleotides (ASOs), RNAi, CRISPR-Cas9 ASOs are brief (12\u201324 nt) single-stranded nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) that regulate gene expression by binding to speci\ufb01c comple- mentary mRNA targets through Watson\u2013Crick base pairing. RNAi controls mRNA stability and cell translation via double-stranded small interfering RNA (siRNA) or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) corresponding to their target RNA [118]. Polyethene glycol- grafted branched polyethyleneimine as a non-viral gene vector has an anti-\ufb01broblast effect through gene silencing technology and is a good approach to prevent \ufb01broblast eye disease [119]. The CRISPR-Cas9 system, an engineered endonuclease directed by a short RNA, can recognize target DNA sites through complemen- tary base pairing and precisely create nicks or cuts in the genome. It", "is simple in structure and is the most popular genome editing tool in gene therapy ocular applications [120]. Ocular Drug Delivery: Overcoming Barriers for Effective Treatment 275 6.2 Exosomes Exosomes consist of lipid bilayers, proteins, and genetic material with 30\u2013150 nm diameter. Exosomes are naturally secreted from cells that play a dynamic role in in\ufb02ammatory, intercellular commu- nication, and immune regulation. As natural carriers, exosomes are non-toxic, biodegradable, safe, able to cross barriers, and can deliver various drugs as compared to synthetic nano-drug carriers [121]. Exosome is an ideal carrier for intraocular delivery of anti- angiogenic peptide KV11 into retinal vasculature by retroorbital injection, which inhibits neovascularization [122]. Moreover, umbilical cord mesenchymal stem\u2013derived exosomes are useful in dry eye disease [13]. Exosomes when combined with drug-loaded liposomes maintains tear balance, tear \ufb01lm stability, pH, and osmo- lality changes [123]. Exosomes due to their low immunogenicity are extremely attractive ocular drug carriers. 6.3 Self-nano Emulsifying Drug Delivery Structures (SNEDDS) SNEDDS are mixtures of oil phases, surfactants, and cosurfactants with droplet sizes below 200 nm. Oil-in-water NEs are spontane- ously formed after slight agitation of aqueous phase dispersion [124]. Surfactant and lipid components synergistically enhance bioavailability by promoting gastrointestinal tract absorption of drugs. Moreover, SNEDDS are promising system for hydrophilic and hydrophobic ocular drug delivery. A self-emulsi\ufb01ed osmo-pro- tective ophthalmic microemulsion (O/A) with an internal oily phase (1.2%), an external aqueous phase (96.3%), and surfactants (1.5%) proved good cell tolerance (\u2248100%) with stability at 8 \u00b0C for 9 months [", "ar drug delivery. A self-emulsi\ufb01ed osmo-pro- tective ophthalmic microemulsion (O/A) with an internal oily phase (1.2%), an external aqueous phase (96.3%), and surfactants (1.5%) proved good cell tolerance (\u2248100%) with stability at 8 \u00b0C for 9 months [125]. Thus, self-emulsi\ufb01ed microemulsions could be a novel ocular drug delivery system. However, SNEDDS have certain limitations, viz. high content of vehicles used in SNEDDS, risk of drug precipitation, and less capacity of drug loading and targeting [126]. 7 Clinical Status of Nanotechnology-Based Ocular Drug Delivery Systems With the increasing number of products in the market, the devel- opment of nanotechnology is proving as a novel ocular drug deliv- ery system in the treatment of ocular diseases. Hence, commercial products are increasing over time to treat ophthalmic conditions. Restasis\u00ae is the \ufb01rst preservative-free cyclosporine A (CsA) oil-in- water emulsion approved by the FDA for the treatment of DED in 2002 [127]. It has a particle size of 100\u2013200 nm with no toxicity but shows side effects such as epiphora and eye irritation. Cequa\u00ae is a nano-micellar formulation containing 0.09% CsA with a particle size of 12\u201320 nm to treat DED. It has enhanced drug delivery and ocular penetration, and a strong encapsulation ability to increase", "CsA concentration ten times [128]. Xelpros\u00ae is a nanoemulsion containing latanoprost approved by the FDA in 2018 to treat high intraocular pressure. It has improved drug residence time (more than 7 days) with 23 times ef\ufb01cacy as compared to latanoprost eye drops [129].

Innovative drug delivery methods, such as NPs, nanomicelles, nanosuspensions, dendrimers, liposomes, contact lenses, hydro- gels, gene delivery, and other novel drug delivery methods, have signi\ufb01cantly enhanced the ef\ufb01cacy of drugs. Nevertheless, numer- ous challenges of complexity and cost of production, safety, meta- bolic fate in ocular tissues, stability, and high technical necessities limit the clinical conversion of nanotechnology-based ocular drug delivery systems.

Lonare, Afroz Jahan, Manjinder Sharma, and Sivaraman Ramanarayanan Abstract The effective oral drug delivery in animals and humans requires an understanding of their unique gastroin- testinal tract (GIT) physiology and biochemical regulators. Oral drugs rely on how effectively absorbed through the intestinal wall and come into systemic circulation. Absorption is hindered by various factors within the enteric epithelium, such as ef\ufb02ux transporters, enzymatic degradation, tight junctions in addition to intestinal linings, and \ufb01rst-pass hepatic metabolism. Factor related to the drugs are hydrophilicity or lipophilicity, high molecular weight, or substrates of ef\ufb02ux transporters, another challenging limiting factor. Thus, careful designing of oral delivery systems is required in order to improve the systemic availability of drug by taking into various factors. The majority of drugs are taken orally, as this route is more convenient and practical, except in emergency and hospitalized conditions. Despite advancements in the pharmaceuti- cal industry, orally administered drugs many times fail to produce the desired effect due to limiting factors of GIT. Here, we discussed the physiological and pharmacological aspects of the GIT. We also tried to discuss the challenges underlying in oral drug delivery and future strategy for improvement of drug delivery via the gastrointestinal tract.

Furthermore, this route is favored for its ease of use, cost-effectiveness (allowing patients to self-administer, thus reducing therapy expenses), and effective therapeutic outcomes. Consequently, these advantages contribute to improved patient adherence to treatment protocols [1].

Lonare et al. Despite its widespread use, drug delivery through the gastroin- testinal tract remains challenging due to the complex anatomical structure and physiological regulatory mechanisms. One signi\ufb01cant obstacle is the acidic environment of the stomach, which can degrade or deactivate many drugs [2]. Another challenge involves the presence of various digestive enzymes in the gastrointestinal tract that can metabolize drugs before they are absorbed into the bloodstream. Additionally, the permeability of the intestinal mucosa can limit the absorption of certain drugs, particularly those with large or hydrophilic molecules. Factors in\ufb02uencing this include the disintegration and dissolution characteristics of drug preparations, lipid solubility, particle size, and the drug\u2019s pKa [3, 4]. Various factors such as disease conditions and surgical proce- dures affecting gastrointestinal anatomy and physiology can also affect drug absorption through the GIT. To improve drug bioavail- ability, technologies such as nano carriers and permeation enhan- cers have been developed to enhance transport across the mucosal barrier. Strategies to mitigate these challenges also include the use of enzyme inhibitors or prodrugs that enhance drug activity and reduce drug inactivation due to enzymatic metabolism in the GIT [5]. Recent advancements in oral drug delivery systems have tack- led challenges associated with anatomical barriers in the GIT, such as the mucosal barrier that impedes drug absorption, along with physiological factors like delayed absorption, taste concerns, gastric irritation, \ufb01rst-pass metabolism, and the in\ufb02uence of the gastroin- testinal environment on drug effectiveness [6]. Additionally, drug delivery to the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) in rumina", "cal factors like delayed absorption, taste concerns, gastric irritation, \ufb01rst-pass metabolism, and the in\ufb02uence of the gastroin- testinal environment on drug effectiveness [6]. Additionally, drug delivery to the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) in ruminant species presents a signi\ufb01cant challenge for the scienti\ufb01c community. Ruminants such as cows, sheep, and goats have a complex stomach structure consisting of four compartments: the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum. This multi-chambered system necessitates specialized drug delivery strategies to ensure effective drug absorption during treatment. The rumen, which houses a large microbial population, can metabolize drugs before they reach absorption sites, thereby reducing bioavailability or potentially disrupting normal micro\ufb02ora [7]. Another factor to consider is the diet of ruminants, which can impact drug absorp- tion. High-\ufb01ber diets may slow gastrointestinal transit time and enhance drug absorption, whereas high-grain diets can expedite passage through the GIT, reducing contact time with absorptive surfaces [8, 9]. Thus, targeted delivery systems are needed to bypass the rumen or release drugs at a controlled rate that aligns with the animal\u2019s digestive kinetics. Formulations needed for rumi- nants often provide protective coatings or encapsulation that pre- vent microbial drug degradation and premature drug release in the rumen [10]. These approaches aim to deliver the active ingredient intact to the lower GI tract where absorption is more favorable.", "Drug Delivery to the Gastrointestinal Tract: Challenges and Opportunities 287 Therefore, targeted delivery systems are essential to bypass the rumen or release drugs at a controlled rate that matches the diges- tive kinetics of the animal. Formulations designed for ruminants often incorporate protective coatings or encapsulation to safeguard against microbial drug degradation and premature release in the rumen [10]. These strategies aim to deliver the active ingredients intact to the lower gastrointestinal tract where absorption is more ef\ufb01cient. 2 Anatomy and Physiology of GIT The gastrointestinal tract (GIT), or alimentary canal, is a funda- mental component of the digestive system, comprising the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine (Fig. 1). It also includes accessory digestive organs such as the salivary glands, liver, pancreas, and gallbladder. Functions of the digestive system encompass ingestion, propulsion, mechanical and chemical digestion, absorption, and defecation. Each organ plays a critical role in breaking down food, releasing nutrients, and facil- itating their absorption into the body [11]. Importantly, each segment exhibits unique anatomical, physiological, and biochemi- cal characteristics that profoundly in\ufb02uence drug delivery, absorp- tion, metabolism, and elimination. Fig. 1 Illustration showing the gastrointestinal tract and different parts of the simple stomach", "288 Milindmitra K. Lonare et al. The alimentary canal is composed of four tissue layers, each tailored to ful\ufb01ll speci\ufb01c functions in different parts. These layers, arranged from the lumen outward, include the mucosa, submu- cosa, muscularis, and serosa [12]. The innermost layer, the mucosa or mucous membrane, is responsible for mucus production. In segments like the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, and anal canal, the mucosa consists of non-keratinized, strati\ufb01ed squamous epithe- lium. In contrast, it comprises columnar epithelium in the stomach and intestines. Goblet cells, which secrete mucus and \ufb02uid into the lumen, and enteroendocrine cells, which release hormones into the spaces between cells, are dispersed among the epithelial cells. Intestinal epithelial cells play a crucial role in maintaining gut balance by forming mucosal barriers that separate gut microbes from the host immune system. These barriers encompass physical defenses like the mucus layer and chemical defenses such as antimi- crobial peptides (AMPs) produced by Paneth cells. Dysfunction of these barriers can lead to intestinal in\ufb02ammation, as observed in conditions like in\ufb02ammatory bowel diseases (IBD), characterized by reduced mucus production and AMP levels. Moreover, intestinal epithelial cells facilitate communication between gut microbes and host immunity by generating cytokines, chemokines, and antimi- crobial substances in response to environmental factors within the gut. This interaction helps regulate immune responses and uphold a symbiotic relationship between gut microbes and the host. The critical role of gut epithelial cells in supporting immune function and overall health is well recognized [13, 14]. Nevertheless, ongo- ing research aims to elucidate how epithelial cells precisely modu- late", "ip between gut microbes and the host. The critical role of gut epithelial cells in supporting immune function and overall health is well recognized [13, 14]. Nevertheless, ongo- ing research aims to elucidate how epithelial cells precisely modu- late immunity, produce antimicrobial peptides, and maintain gut equilibrium. The lamina propria, surrounding the epithelium, is composed of loose connective tissue, blood vessels, and lymphatics that trans- port absorbed nutrients from the lumen to various parts of the body. Additionally, the lamina propria serves as an immunomodu- latory center, housing clusters of lymphocytes in the mucosa- associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). Particularly well-de\ufb01ned in the ileum, these are known as \u201cPeyer\u2019s patches\u201d and are distributed throughout the small intestine, primarily on the antimesenteric side. They include components such as high endothelial venules, T cells, B cells, and follicular dendritic cells, organized into germi- nal centers, follicular areas, parafollicular areas, and dome areas, each with distinct cellular compositions and functions [15]. The outermost layer of the mucosa, known as the muscularis mucosae, is a thin layer of smooth muscle that contributes to the formation of folds in the mucosa, signi\ufb01cantly increasing the sur- face area available for absorption. Directly beneath this layer, the submucosa is histologically positioned and lies beneath the muscu- laris mucosae and muscularis layers. It comprises a broad array of", "connective tissue, blood vessels, lymphatics, and submucosal glands that secrete digestive enzymes, and a network of nerve \ufb01bers known as the submucosal plexus or Meissner\u2019s plexus [16]. Drug Delivery to the Gastrointestinal Tract: Challenges and Opportunities 289 The muscularis layer, which is the third layer of the alimentary canal, consists of two layers of smooth muscle, except at the most proximal and distal ends where it is composed of skeletal muscle providing voluntary control. The inner circular layer of smooth muscle and the outer longitudinal layer together form the muscu- laris layer [17]. The primary function of this layer is to facilitate mechanical digestion, reduce particle size for enzymatic action, and propel food through the alimentary canal via peristaltic movement. The serosa is the outermost layer of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) found within the abdominal cavity. It is composed of a layer of visceral peritoneum and loose connective tissue that provides structural support and anchors the GIT in place. Drugs adminis- tered via the enteral route pass through the following segments of the GIT. 2.1 Mouth and Esophagus When drugs are taken orally, they initially enter the mouth where they mix with saliva. Saliva, which typically has a pH range of 6.2\u20137.6 with an average pH of 6.7, plays a crucial role in oral drug administration. Firstly, saliva aids in breaking down carbohy- drates and helps eliminate acids produced by bacteria. Secondly, it neutralizes acidity from beverages and food, thus providing a buff- ering effect that protects the oral cavity and the drug itself. After mixing with saliva in the mouth, drugs then pass through the esophagus. In this part of the digestive tract, they undergo further mechanical and enzymatic digestion processes.", "uff- ering effect that protects the oral cavity and the drug itself. After mixing with saliva in the mouth, drugs then pass through the esophagus. In this part of the digestive tract, they undergo further mechanical and enzymatic digestion processes. Despite the rela- tively short transit time in the esophagus, these initial stages of digestion are important as they prepare the drug for absorption and subsequent distribution throughout the body. Understanding how drugs interact with saliva and the esophagus is essential for optimizing oral drug delivery. Researchers continue to explore these processes to enhance drug effectiveness and ensure predict- able absorption rates [18]. 2.2 Stomach The stomach acts as a reservoir for digesting ingested food, main- taining a highly acidic environment (pH 1.5\u20133.5) through the secretion of gastric acid. This acidity facilitates food digestion and helps in eliminating bacteria [11]. While the stomach provides a limited area for the absorption of acidic drugs, its acidic conditions can also degrade acid-labile or basic drugs, thereby reducing their solubility and effectiveness. This dual role underscores the sto- mach\u2019s critical in\ufb02uence on both digestion and drug behavior within the body.", "290 Milindmitra K. Lonare et al. 2.3 Small Intestine The small intestine is composed of three main parts: the duode- num, jejunum, and ileum, serving as the primary location for drug absorption. The jejunum and ileum, especially due to their exten- sive microvilli, provide a large surface area, totaling approximately 200 m2 in adult humans [6]. This feature greatly enhances the absorption of many weakly basic drugs, facilitated by the pH gradi- ent ranging from around 6 in the duodenum to 7.4 in the terminal ileum. Conversely, the small intestine plays a crucial role in the ionization of weakly acidic drugs, thereby regulating their absorp- tion [19]. It plays a major role in absorption of water and salts from the digesta. 2.4 Ruminant Digestive System The digestive system of ruminant animals is uniquely structured to ef\ufb01ciently utilize high-\ufb01ber feed. Unlike monogastric animals, ruminants possess a four-compartment stomach consisting of the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum, in addition to other common digestive organs (Fig. 2). Feed and forage are mixed with saliva in the mouth and transported through the esophagus to the reticulum [20]. The pH of saliva varies among different ruminant species: buffalo 8.8, sheep 8.12\u20138.32, goats 8.2\u20138.8, calves 8.1\u20138.23, and cattle 8.55\u20138.90 [21\u201323]. Saliva serves essential roles in chewing and swallowing, containing enzymes that aid in the initial breakdown of food. One of its crucial functions is to regulate pH levels in the reticulum and rumen, facilitating the digestion of fats and starches [24]. Muscle contractions and pres- sure differentials propel these substances down the esophagus into the reticulum. The reticulum features a honeycomb-like structure designed to trap and collect dense objects that ruminants inadvertentl", "nd starches [24]. Muscle contractions and pres- sure differentials propel these substances down the esophagus into the reticulum. The reticulum features a honeycomb-like structure designed to trap and collect dense objects that ruminants inadvertently con- sume, such as nails or wires. The rumen, commonly known as the \u201cpaunch,\u201d features a lining of papillae that signi\ufb01cantly boosts nutrient absorption. It is segmented into sacs by muscular pillars, serving as the main site for microbial fermentation, especially of complex, high-\ufb01ber foods. Within this chamber, anaerobic condi- tions prevail, facilitating the breakdown of cellulose and complex starches. Additionally, it supports the synthesis of proteins from non-protein nitrogen (NPN) and the production of essential vita- mins like B and K. The pH of the rumen generally ranges between 6.5 and 6.8. The omasum is spherical and connects to the reticulum through a short tunnel. It is nicknamed the \u201cmany piles\u201d or the \u201cbutcher\u2019s bible\u201d due to its numerous folds, resembling pages of a book. These folds signi\ufb01cantly increase surface area, enhancing nutrient and water absorption from the feed. Water absorption speci\ufb01cally occurs in the omasum, which is well-developed and large in cattle.", "Drug Delivery to the Gastrointestinal Tract: Challenges and Opportunities 291 Fig. 2 Illustration showing the gastrointestinal tract of ruminants and different parts of the compound stomach The abomasum functions as the ruminant\u2019s \u201ctrue stomach,\u201d analogous to the stomach in non-ruminants. It produces hydro- chloric acid and digestive enzymes like pepsin (for protein break- down) and receives enzymes from the pancreas such as pancreatic lipase (for fat breakdown). These secretions prepare proteins for absorption in the intestines. The abomasum maintains a pH typi- cally ranging from 3.5 to 4.0 and secretes mucus to protect its lining from acid damage. Following the abomasum, the small and large intestines serve as additional sites for nutrient absorption. The small intestine, up to 150 feet long in a mature cow with a 20-gallon capacity, receives", "digesta mixed with pancreatic and liver secretions. These secretions raise the pH from about 2.5 to a range between 7 and 8, optimizing conditions for digestion and absorption. 292 Milindmitra K. Lonare et al. Immature ruminants, such as very young ones from birth to approximately 2\u20133 months old, functionally operate as non-ruminants. During this stage, a specialized structure called the reticular (esophageal) groove, formed by muscular folds of the reticulum, directs milk directly to the omasum and then to the abomasum, bypassing the reticulorumen. Thus, when drugs are administered orally to calf, they may enter the abomasum directly instead of the rumen, where they bypass microbial degra- dation or inactivation. Conversely, if drugs used in these adult animals are excreted in manure, may degraded by micro\ufb02ora, or alters the micro\ufb02ora, it can potentially alter their ef\ufb01cacy. Immature ruminants should not be given access to feeds containing non-protein nitrogen (urea). They are also more sensitive to gossy- pol and dietary fat levels compared to mature ruminants. When designing nutritional programs for ruminants, it is crucial to con- sider the age of the animals. 3 Blood Supply The gastrointestinal system receives blood supply from both intra- mural and extramural components. Intramurally, there are well- developed vascular distributions with plexuses present in different layers of the bowel wall. These plexuses are specialized in organs such as the liver, small intestine, and gastroesophageal junction, tailored to their respective functions. Extramurally, the arterial supply to the esophagus originates from the thoracic aorta or its major branches. Abdominal organs are supplied by three principal unpaired vessels arising from the abdominal aorta: the coeliac trunk, an", "spective functions. Extramurally, the arterial supply to the esophagus originates from the thoracic aorta or its major branches. Abdominal organs are supplied by three principal unpaired vessels arising from the abdominal aorta: the coeliac trunk, and the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries. Branches from these vessels form interconnected networks (anastomoses), ensuring a robust blood supply to the adjacent organs [25, 26]. 4 Nerve Supply The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is innervated by intrinsic neurons of the enteric nervous system (ENS) and by axons from extrinsic sympathetic, parasympathetic, and visceral afferent neurons. Both intrinsic and extrinsic innervation are in\ufb02uenced by age [27]. Extrinsic innervation of the gut comes from neurons located in prevertebral ganglia, the brainstem, and peripheral afferent ganglia. Noradrenergic \ufb01bers within the GI tract wall originate from cell bodies in the prevertebral sympathetic ganglia.", "Drug Delivery to the Gastrointestinal Tract: Challenges and Opportunities 293 The myenteric plexus (MP), situated between the muscle layers of the GI tract, is the outer of the two major ENS plexuses. It plays a primary role in initiating and regulating smooth muscle motor patterns such as peristalsis [28]. Speci\ufb01cally, the celiac-mesenteric ganglia supply \ufb01bers to the stomach, small intestine, and partially to the proximal large intestine. The inferior mesenteric ganglia pro- vide \ufb01bers to the large intestine, while noradrenergic \ufb01bers to the rectum originate from the pelvic ganglia [29]. The vagus nerve serves dual roles in the gastrointestinal system, providing both sensory (afferent \ufb01bers) and motor (efferent \ufb01bers) functions. Vagal afferent \ufb01bers extend into extensive networks, forming endings in the smooth muscle, mesenteric plexus, and mucosa. Within the smooth muscle, these endings are referred to as intramuscular arrays, while within the myenteric ganglia, they are termed intraganglionic laminar endings [30]. This intricate net- work allows the vagus nerve to play a crucial role in sensing and regulating various gastrointestinal functions. 5 Challenges in GIT Drug Delivery There are various factors that play a critical role in modulating the effect of drugs. They may interfere in the activity of the drugs; make them inactive, increase metabolism or increase elimination; and limit their pharmacological activity (Fig. 3). 5.1 Acidic Environment of the Stomach The highly acidic environment of the stomach can degrade drugs that are sensitive to low pH. Some examples include penicillin, erythromycin, tetracycline, omeprazole, esomeprazole, insulin, aspirin, and morphine (some formulations of morphine). Hence, the development of enteric coatings preparation or other ", "ugs that are sensitive to low pH. Some examples include penicillin, erythromycin, tetracycline, omeprazole, esomeprazole, insulin, aspirin, and morphine (some formulations of morphine). Hence, the development of enteric coatings preparation or other protective mechanisms is necessary to ensure that the drug reaches the intes- tine intact.

Lonare et al. 5.2 Alkaline pH of the Intestine Drugs can degrade under alkaline pH conditions due to various chemical reactions. Some common degradation mechanisms include: hydrolysis (many drugs contain ester, amide, or other functional groups may undergo hydrolysis); oxidation (some drugs under go oxidation reactions lead to the formation of inactive or potentially toxic by-products); isomerization (isomerization of drugs, altering their chemical structure and potentially affecting their therapeutic activity); decarboxylation (drugs with carboxylic acid groups may undergo decarboxylation). Here are some exam- ples of drugs that may degrade under alkaline conditions are barbi- turates, epinephrine, erythromycin, chlorpromazine, protease inhibitors, etc. 5.3 Variable GI Transit Times The transit time through different segments of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract follows a normal range: gastric emptying typically takes 2\u20135 h, small bowel transit 2\u20136 h, colonic transit 10\u201359 h, and whole gut transit 10\u201373 h. This timing can vary signi\ufb01cantly between individuals and within the same person at different times [31], impacting drug absorption and bioavailability. For orally administered drugs, it generally takes around 3 h to pass through the small intestine to the beginning of the colon. While designing formulations must consider the speci\ufb01c character- istics of the colon, which in\ufb02uence development strategies. The total transit time through the colon varies widely due to factors like diet, mobility, stress, diseases, and concurrent medications [32]. The colon serves as a site for both local and systemic drug delivery, offering signi\ufb01cant therapeutic advantages. Traditionally, immediate-release formulations release drugs in the upper GI tract, where the smal", "ases, and concurrent medications [32]. The colon serves as a site for both local and systemic drug delivery, offering signi\ufb01cant therapeutic advantages. Traditionally, immediate-release formulations release drugs in the upper GI tract, where the small intestine maximizes absorption due to its extensive surface area and abundant transporter proteins. However, con- trolled-release formulations are now designed to release drugs over 12\u201324 h [20], targeting speci\ufb01c therapeutic bene\ufb01ts in the colon and has some signi\ufb01cance in colonic diseases. 5.4 Presence of Digestive Enzymes and Gut Micro\ufb02ora Digestive enzymes present in the stomach and intestine can degrade certain drugs before they are absorbed, thereby diminish- ing their effectiveness. Additionally, oral digestive enzymes may experience reduced ef\ufb01cacy when taken alongside antacids contain- ing calcium or magnesium. For instance, amylase or other carbohydrate-digesting enzymes can potentially decrease the effec- tiveness of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors like acarbose or miglitol. Pharmaceutical formulations are meticulously crafted with consid- eration for digestive enzymes. Enteric-coated formulations, for example, are speci\ufb01cally designed to withstand degradation by stomach acid and enzymes. This design ensures that the drug reaches targeted sites in the gastrointestinal tract intact, optimizing its absorption and therapeutic bene\ufb01t.", "Drug Delivery to the Gastrointestinal Tract: Challenges and Opportunities 295 Disintegration of dosage form and dissolution of drug can be controlled by formulation but can be affected by peristaltic move- ment, luminal pH, and the release of bile salts and the presence of food. For most of the drugs (excluding some sustained release formulations), absorption occurs from duodenum and jejunum. Transcellular absorption predominates for most of the lipophilic drugs, whereas the polar, hydrophilic compounds are taken up via paracellular [33, 34]. Intestinal microbial metabolism of drugs involves the synthesis of reductase enzymes by gut microbiota, leading to azo reduction or nitro-reduction of certain drugs. A notable example of this process includes prodrugs like prontosil, neoprontosil, sulfasala- zine, balsalazide, and olsalazine, which undergo reduction by reductase enzymes produced by gut micro\ufb02ora. Additionally, intes- tinal micro\ufb02ora produce nitro-reductase enzymes that catalyze the nitroreduction of drugs such as nitrazepam, clonazepam, broma- zepam, metronidazole, misonidazole, chloramphenicol, and digoxin [35]. Erythromycin and tetracycline are known to inhibit the reduction of digoxin [36]. Additionally, certain drugs undergo hydrolysis by intestinal micro\ufb02ora, including methotrexate, sodium picosulfate, irinotecan, and sorivudine. Intestinal micro\ufb02ora are also involved in various other meta- bolic processes such as oxidation (e.g., levamisole), deamination (e.g., 5-\ufb02uorocytosine), denitration (e.g., glyceryl trinitrate, iso- sorbide dinitrate), deacetylation (e.g., phenacetin), and decarbox- ylation (e.g., L-Dopa) [37\u201340]. These interactions underscore the complex role of intestinal micro\ufb02ora in drug metabolism, in\ufb02uen- cing drug effectiveness, toxicity, and ov", "ate, iso- sorbide dinitrate), deacetylation (e.g., phenacetin), and decarbox- ylation (e.g., L-Dopa) [37\u201340]. These interactions underscore the complex role of intestinal micro\ufb02ora in drug metabolism, in\ufb02uen- cing drug effectiveness, toxicity, and overall therapeutic outcomes. Understanding these processes is crucial for optimizing drug thera- pies and managing their interactions with gut microbiota. 5.5 Metabolizing Enzymes and Ef\ufb02ux Transporters Drug-metabolizing enzymes in the gut mucosa serve a crucial role in limiting the systemic exposure of drugs absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, a feature believed to have evolved in herbivo- rous or omnivorous animals. The proximal small intestine, particu- larly the villi, represents the optimal site for drug absorption. The columnar epithelial cells lining the gastrointestinal surface are rich in oxidative, conjugative, and hydrolytic drug-metabolizing enzymes. When foreign molecules penetrate the intestinal capillary bed via diffusion or transport across the luminal plasma membrane of mature enterocytes, they encounter this enzymatic barrier. High enzyme activity levels can result in near-complete extraction ef\ufb01- ciency during \ufb01rst-pass metabolism at the mucosal epithelium [33, 41]. Once drugs move into the villous epithelium, they are poised for intracellular enzymatic metabolism. In the case of pep- tide or peptide-based drugs, degradation by extracellular enzymes can also take place within the epithelial brush border and the unstirred water layer [34].", "296 Milindmitra K. Lonare et al. Ef\ufb02ux transporters like P-glycoprotein and metabolic enzymes such as cytochrome P450 present in the intestinal epithelium play a crucial role in limiting drug absorption. These transporters can actively pump drugs back into the intestinal lumen, while metabolic enzymes can metabolize drugs before they have a chance to enter systemic circulation [42]. This intricate interplay underscores how the physiological barriers within the gastrointestinal tract impact the bioavailability and effectiveness of drugs, in\ufb02uencing their pharmacokinetics and therapeutic outcomes. 6 Future Opportunities in GIT Drug Delivery Advanced drug formulation techniques such as nanoparticle-based delivery systems, liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, control release system, etc. are employed to safeguard drugs from degrada- tion, enhance their solubility, and augment their release and absorption (Fig. 4). 6.1 Nanoparticle- Based Delivery Systems Nanoparticles have emerged as a promising strategy to enhance drug delivery in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. These particles, typically ranging from 1 to 1000 nm, are designed to enhance drug solubility, stability, and bioavailability. Engineered nanoparti- cles can shield drugs from the acidic environment of the stomach Future opportunities in GIT drug delivery Nanoparticle -based delivery systems Fig. 4 Future opportunity for the effective GIT drug delivery development", "and facilitate their transport across the intestinal epithelium. For instance, polymeric nanoparticles can encapsulate drugs, offering a protective shield against degradation and enhancing drug stability within the GI tract. Moreover, nanoparticles can be functionalized with speci\ufb01c ligands to target precise cells or tissues, thereby opti- mizing drug delivery accuracy. Drug Delivery to the Gastrointestinal Tract: Challenges and Opportunities 297 6.1.1 Targeted Delivery Systems Targeted delivery systems like prodrugs and ligand-conjugated nanoparticles offer the capability to deliver drugs precisely to selected regions of the gastrointestinal tract or speci\ufb01c cell types. These systems can be designed to release drugs in response to speci\ufb01c stimuli or to target speci\ufb01c receptors. This precision enhances drug ef\ufb01cacy and diminishes potential side effects. 6.1.2 Ligand-Conjugated Nanoparticles Ligand-conjugated nanoparticles are designed to target speci\ufb01c receptors on the surface of cells in the GI tract. By conjugating nanoparticles with ligands that bind to these receptors, it is possible to achieve targeted drug delivery. This approach can improve the precision of drug delivery, enhance therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy, and reduce side effects. Examples of ligands used for targeting include anti- bodies, peptides, and small molecules. 6.1.3 Liposomes Liposomes are spherical vesicles made of phospholipid bilayers capable of encapsulating both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs. They serve as a versatile drug delivery system, shielding drugs from degradation and promoting enhanced absorption. Liposomes can be tailored for controlled release, optimizing drug pharmacokinetics. Furthermore, they can be engineered with tar- geting ligands to precisely direct drug delivery to speci\ufb01c locati", "s from degradation and promoting enhanced absorption. Liposomes can be tailored for controlled release, optimizing drug pharmacokinetics. Furthermore, they can be engineered with tar- geting ligands to precisely direct drug delivery to speci\ufb01c locations within the gastrointestinal tract, thereby boosting therapeutic effectiveness. 6.1.4 Solid Lipid Nanoparticles Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) represent a promising oral delivery system. These nanoparticles consist of biocompatible and biode- gradable lipids that ef\ufb01ciently encapsulate drugs, thereby enhancing their stability and bioavailability. SLNs offer several advantages, including controlled release of drugs, superior drug protection, and the capability to encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs. Moreover, SLNs can be engineered to circumvent ef\ufb02ux transporters, thereby augmenting drug absorption in the gastroin- testinal tract. 6.2 Controlled Release Systems Controlled release systems are designed to deliver drugs at a pre- determined rate, prolonging their therapeutic effect and reducing the frequency of administration. These systems can be tailored to release drugs in response to speci\ufb01c stimuli or over an extended period. Controlled release formulations, such as osmotic pumps", "and matrix systems, effectively regulate the gradual release of drugs, thereby enhancing their bioavailability and potentially reducing the frequency of dosing. 298 Milindmitra K. Lonare et al. 6.2.1 Osmotic Pumps Osmotic pumps represent sophisticated controlled-release mechan- isms harnessing osmotic pressure for precise drug delivery. These devices feature a semipermeable membrane that allows water to permeate, creating pressure that expels the drug through a delivery port. This technology ensures consistent and reliable release of medication, maintaining steady plasma concentrations regardless of external factors. Osmotic pumps are particularly bene\ufb01cial for medications requiring exact dosing and sustained therapeutic levels in the bloodstream. 6.2.2 Matrix Systems Matrix systems constitute a distinct category of controlled-release formulations where the drug is uniformly dispersed within a poly- mer matrix. Drug release occurs either as the matrix gradually erodes or through diffusion processes. This design enables matrix systems to effectively extend drug release durations, thereby enhancing patient adherence and ensuring consistent therapeutic drug levels. These systems are highly adaptable, capable of being customized to release drugs at speci\ufb01ed rates and in response to speci\ufb01c stimuli. 6.3 Mucoadhesive Systems Mucoadhesive drug delivery systems are engineered to adhere to the mucosal lining of the gastrointestinal tract, thereby extending the drug\u2019s residence time and enhancing its absorption. These systems are formulated as tablets, gels, or \ufb01lms, utilizing polymers that interact effectively with the mucin layer of the GI tract. 6.3.1 Mucoadhesive Polymers Mucoadhesive formulations are speci\ufb01cally engineered to cling to the mucosal lining of the gastrointestin", "ulated as tablets, gels, or \ufb01lms, utilizing polymers that interact effectively with the mucin layer of the GI tract. 6.3.1 Mucoadhesive Polymers Mucoadhesive formulations are speci\ufb01cally engineered to cling to the mucosal lining of the gastrointestinal tract, thereby prolonging the drug\u2019s presence and facilitating improved absorption. Utilizing mucoadhesive polymers like chitosan, carbopol, and polyvinyl alco- hol, these formulations establish robust bonds with the mucosal surface, effectively extending the drug\u2019s retention time at the absorption site. This prolonged interaction signi\ufb01cantly enhances the drug\u2019s bioavailability and can optimize its therapeutic impact. Mucoadhesive systems prove particularly advantageous for drugs with low absorption rates or those requiring precise delivery within the gastrointestinal tract. 6.4 Absorption Enhancers Absorption enhancers work by temporarily disrupting tight junc- tions or inhibiting ef\ufb02ux transporters, thereby increasing the per- meability of drugs across the intestinal epithelium and enhancing their absorption. Absorption enhancers are compounds that can temporarily increase the permeability of the intestinal epithelium,", "facilitating the transport of drugs across the barrier. These enhan- cers can disrupt tight junctions or inhibit ef\ufb02ux transporters, improving drug absorption. Drug Delivery to the Gastrointestinal Tract: Challenges and Opportunities 299 6.5 Tight Junction Modulators Tight junction modulators are substances capable of temporarily opening the tight junctions between epithelial cells, thereby enhancing paracellular permeability. Examples of these modulators include chitosan, zonula occludens toxin, and speci\ufb01c peptides. Through their action in disrupting tight junctions, these com- pounds facilitate improved absorption of large molecules and drugs that typically have low permeability. This mechanism is instrumental in enhancing the bioavailability of such substances. 6.6 Development of Prodrugs Prodrugs are inactive compounds that are converted to active drugs in the body through metabolic processes. By designing prodrugs that are speci\ufb01cally activated in the GI tract, it is possible to enhance drug absorption and target speci\ufb01c regions of the GI tract. For example, prodrugs that are activated by enzymes present in the colon can be used to deliver drugs speci\ufb01cally to the large intestine. 6.7 Ef\ufb02ux Transporter Inhibitors Ef\ufb02ux transporters, such as P-glycoprotein, function to restrict drug absorption by actively transporting drugs back into the gas- trointestinal lumen. Inhibitors of these transporters play a crucial role in enhancing drug absorption by reducing this ef\ufb02ux mecha- nism. Examples of ef\ufb02ux transporter inhibitors include verapamil, cyclosporine A, and speci\ufb01c \ufb02avonoids. Through inhibition of ef\ufb02ux transporters, these compounds effectively enhance the bio- availability of drugs that are substrates for these transporters, thereby optimizing therapeutic outcomes", "include verapamil, cyclosporine A, and speci\ufb01c \ufb02avonoids. Through inhibition of ef\ufb02ux transporters, these compounds effectively enhance the bio- availability of drugs that are substrates for these transporters, thereby optimizing therapeutic outcomes. 7 Conclusion In conclusion, while drug delivery to the gastrointestinal tract presents formidable obstacles due to its intricate environment and physiological dynamics, the \ufb01eld also holds immense promise for innovative solutions. Advances in formulation techniques, con- trolled release systems, and targeted delivery strategies offer com- pelling avenues to overcome these challenges. Technologies such as nanoparticle-based systems, osmotic pumps, and mucoadhesive formulations demonstrate the potential to enhance drug stability, improve absorption, and prolong therapeutic effect. Furthermore, the integration of absorption enhancers and targeted delivery sys- tems holds the key to achieving precise drug delivery and maximiz- ing therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy while minimizing adverse effects. As research progresses and our understanding of gastrointestinal phys- iology deepens, the future of GI drug delivery looks promising, poised to usher in new standards of effectiveness and patient care in pharmacotherapy.", "300 Milindmitra K.

However, the development of effective respiratory drug delivery systems encounters several challenges, including overcoming the lungs\u2019 innate defense mechanisms, achieving uniform drug distribution, and formulating stable and respirable drug particles. This chapter examines the anatomy and physiology of the respiratory system, focusing on aspects relevant to drug delivery, such as air\ufb02ow dynamics, mucociliary clearance, and alveolar-capillary barrier function. Traditional methods of respiratory drug delivery, including metered-dose inhalers, dry powder inhalers, and nebulizers, are analyzed, elucidating their operational principles, advantages, and limitations.

By directly administering medications at the site of action, respiratory drug delivery systems can achieve higher local drug concentrations at Abhishek Pathak and Satya Pal Singh (eds.), Next-Generation Drug Delivery Systems, Methods in Pharmacology and Toxicology, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-4554-3_14, \u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025 303", "reduced doses, potentially improving patient outcomes and mini- mizing the risk of adverse effects [1]. 304 Pabbathi Shivakumar et al. However, the development of ef\ufb01cacious respiratory drug delivery systems remains challenging. The primary obstacle is over- coming the innate defense mechanisms of the respiratory tract, which are designed to impede the entry of foreign particles. These barriers include mucus layers, ciliary clearance, and complex airway geometry, all of which can hinder the deposition and reten- tion of therapeutic agents. An additional signi\ufb01cant challenge is achieving uniform drug distribution throughout the lungs. The intricate branching struc- ture of the airways and the heterogeneous nature of lung diseases can result in uneven drug deposition, potentially leading to subop- timal treatment ef\ufb01cacy. Factors such as particle size, inhalation technique, and device design play crucial roles in determining the distribution and deposition patterns of inhaled medications. Moreover, the formulation of drugs for respiratory delivery presents a unique challenge. Ensuring the stability of active phar- maceutical ingredients, developing appropriate particle engineering techniques, and designing delivery devices capable of generating respirable aerosols with consistent and reproducible characteristics are critical for successful respiratory drug delivery systems. Recent advances in nanotechnology, particle engineering, and device design have revealed new avenues for addressing these chal- lenges. Innovative approaches, such as nanocarriers, smart inhalers, and targeted delivery systems, are being investigated to enhance the ef\ufb01cacy and precision of respiratory drug delivery. 2 Anatomy and Physiology of the Respiratory System It explains lung physiology by focus", "es, such as nanocarriers, smart inhalers, and targeted delivery systems, are being investigated to enhance the ef\ufb01cacy and precision of respiratory drug delivery. 2 Anatomy and Physiology of the Respiratory System It explains lung physiology by focusing on aspects relevant to drug delivery, such as air\ufb02ow dynamics, mucociliary clearance, and alveolar-capillary barrier function. Understanding these factors is crucial for developing effective drug delivery strategies [2]. The respiratory system comprises a sophisticated network of organs and tissues, facilitating gas exchange between the body and the envi- ronment. Their anatomical and physiological aspects are crucial for understanding drug delivery mechanisms and developing ef\ufb01ca- cious therapeutic strategies. The respiratory system facilitates gas exchange between the body and the environment and serves as a potential route for drug delivery. Understanding its anatomy and physiology is crucial for the development of effective therapeutic strategies [3]. 1. Upper Airways: The upper airways encompass the nose, nasal cavity, pharynx, and larynx, which \ufb01lter, warm, and humidify the incoming air. The nasal cavity is lined with ciliated", "Drug Delivery to the Respiratory System: Novel Approaches and Therapeutics 305 epithelium and mucus-producing goblet cells that entrap par- ticles and pathogens [4]. Contemporary research has focused on the role of nasal epithelial cells in innate immunity and their potential as drug delivery targets. 2. Lower Airways: The lower airway includes the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles. The trachea bifurcates into two main bronchi, which subsequently divide into smaller bronchioles [5]. This branching pattern, termed the bronchial tree, augments the surface area for gas exchange. Recent investigations have elu- cidated the signi\ufb01cance of bronchial smooth muscle in regulat- ing air\ufb02ow and its role in pathologies such as asthma [6]. 3. Alveoli: The alveoli serve as the primary sites of gas exchange. These microscopic air sacs are enveloped by a network of capillaries, forming an alveolar-capillary interface. Recent research has illuminated the complexity of alveolar epithelial cells, including type I cells (for gas exchange) and type II cells (for surfactant production) [7]. Understanding alveolar struc- ture and function is essential for developing inhaled medica- tions and nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems. 4. Pulmonary Vasculature: Pulmonary circulation is characterized by a low-pressure, high-\ufb02ow system that facilitates gas exchange [8]. Recent studies have emphasized the role of pulmonary endothelial cells in maintaining vascular homeosta- sis and their potential as drug targets. The distinctive structure of pulmonary capillaries, with their thin walls and extensive surface area, renders them ideal for rapid drug absorption [9]. 5. Air\ufb02ow Dynamics: Air\ufb02ow in the respiratory system is complex and varies throughout the respiratory cycle. Recent computa- tional \ufb02uid ", "capillaries, with their thin walls and extensive surface area, renders them ideal for rapid drug absorption [9]. 5. Air\ufb02ow Dynamics: Air\ufb02ow in the respiratory system is complex and varies throughout the respiratory cycle. Recent computa- tional \ufb02uid dynamics studies have provided insights into air\ufb02ow patterns in different regions of the lungs [10]. This knowledge is crucial for optimizing inhaled drug delivery, particularly for targeting speci\ufb01c pulmonary regions. 6. Mucociliary Clearance: The respiratory tract is lined with a mucus layer and ciliated epithelium, which function synergisti- cally to trap and remove particles. Recent studies have eluci- dated the importance of mucus composition and ciliary beat frequency in the maintenance of this protective mechanism [11]. Understanding mucociliary clearance is essential for the development of drugs that can overcome this barrier and reach their intended targets. 7. Alveolar-Capillary Barrier Function: The alveolar-capillary barrier regulates the exchange of gases and substances between the alveolar space and blood. Recent studies have focused on the role of tight junctions and transport proteins in the main- tenance of this barrier [12]. Understanding the mechanism of", "306 Pabbathi Shivakumar et al. transepithelial transport is crucial for the development of drugs that can effectively overcome this barrier. 8. Lung Microbiome: Recent studies have highlighted the signi\ufb01- cance of the lung microbiome in respiratory health and disease. The composition of the lung microbiome can in\ufb02uence drug metabolism and ef\ufb01cacy, making it an important consideration in drug delivery. 9. Respiratory Immune System: The lungs possess a sophisticated immune system that includes alveolar macrophages, dendritic cells, and lymphoid tissues [13]. Recent studies have focused on harnessing immune components for targeted drug delivery and immunomodulation. A comprehensive understanding of respiratory anatomy and physiology is indispensable for the development of effective drug delivery strategies. Recent advancements in imaging technologies, molecular biology, and computational modeling have provided novel insights into lung structure and function, thereby creating new possibilities for targeted and personalized respiratory therapies. 3 Traditional Methods of Respiratory Drug Delivery Inhalation devices, such as metered-dose inhalers (MDIs), dry powder inhalers (DPIs), and nebulizers, are traditional methods of pulmonary drug delivery [14]. Traditional respiratory drug delivery methods encompass three primary types of inhalation devices: metered-dose inhalers (MDIs), dry powder inhalers (DPIs), and nebulizers. Each device exhibits distinct operational principles, advantages, and limitations. 3.1 Metered-Dose Inhalers (MDIs) MDIs consist of a pressurized canister containing the drug in solution or suspension, along with propellants. Upon activation, the device dispenses a precise dose of medication in aerosol form. Pressurized metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs) offer s", "(MDIs) MDIs consist of a pressurized canister containing the drug in solution or suspension, along with propellants. Upon activation, the device dispenses a precise dose of medication in aerosol form. Pressurized metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs) offer several advantages, including portability and compactness, rapid drug delivery, consistent dose administration, and compatibility with a wide range of medications [15]. These features make pMDIs a popular choice for delivery of respiratory medications. However, they also have limitations that must be considered. Users must coordinate actuation with inhalation, which can be challenging for some patients [16]. There is potential for oropharyngeal depo- sition, reducing the amount of medication reaching the lungs. The cold-Freon effect may cause throat irritation in some patients. In addition, environmental concerns have been raised regarding the propellants used in pMDIs. Despite these limitations, pMDIs", "remain a widely used and effective method for the delivery of inhaled medications. Drug Delivery to the Respiratory System: Novel Approaches and Therapeutics 307 3.2 Dry Powder Inhalers (DPIs) Dry powder inhalers (DPIs) administer medication in powdered form, utilizing the patient\u2019s inhalation to generate aerosols and disperse the powder into respirable particles [17]. These devices present several advantages: they are breath-activated, thereby miti- gating coordination challenges; they are propellant-free; they pro- vide stable formulations; and they generally offer enhanced user- friendliness compared with metered dose inhalers (MDIs) [18]. However, DPIs also possess certain limitations, including the necessity for suf\ufb01cient inspiratory \ufb02ow, susceptibility of powder formulations to moisture, and potential variability in dosage deliv- ery based on the patient\u2019s inspiratory effort [19] (Fig. 1). 3.3 Nebulizers These are medical devices that transform liquid medication into a \ufb01ne mist for inhalation by utilizing compressed air, ultrasonic waves, or a vibrating mesh [20]. These apparatuses offer several advantages, including their suitability for patients with reduced inspiratory \ufb02ow, capacity to administer substantial medication doses, applicability for pharmaceuticals not available in alternative inhaler formats, and minimal requirements for patient coordination [21]. However, nebulizers have certain limitations. They are com- paratively bulky and less portable than other inhalation devices, Fig. 1 Schematic illustration showing particle deposition pattern", "wing particle deposition pattern", "necessitate time-consuming treatment sessions, present a risk of contamination if not properly maintained, and may result in poten- tial medication waste [22]. Notwithstanding these drawbacks, nebulizers remain a signi\ufb01cant option for the administration of respiratory medications, particularly in patients who may experi- ence dif\ufb01culties with other inhaler types. 308 Pabbathi Shivakumar et al. Drug deposition in the lungs is in\ufb02uenced by several factors, including particle size, inhalation technique, device characteristics, and patient-speci\ufb01c variables [23]. Optimal lung deposition is gen- erally achieved with particle sizes ranging from 1 to 5 \u03bcm, while particles exceeding 5 \u03bcm tend to deposit in the upper airways, and those smaller than 1 \u03bcm may be exhaled. Effective drug delivery is contingent upon proper inhalation techniques, which encompasses slow, deep inhalation followed by breath-holding, correct device usage and positioning, as well as comprehensive patient education and training [24]. The characteristics of the delivery device, such as aerosol generation mechanism, dose consistency, and ease of use and maintenance, also signi\ufb01cantly impact drug deposition. Fur- thermore, patient-speci\ufb01c factors, including lung anatomy, disease state, inspiratory \ufb02ow rate, age, and cognitive abilities, contribute to variability in drug deposition within the lungs. Traditional methods of pulmonary drug delivery encounter numerous challenges that researchers and healthcare professionals are actively addressing. These challenges include enhancing lung deposition ef\ufb01ciency; improving patient adherence and technique; developing formulations for a wider range of medications; addres- sing the speci\ufb01c needs of diverse patient populations (e.g., pediat- ric, elderly); optimizing the b", "ude enhancing lung deposition ef\ufb01ciency; improving patient adherence and technique; developing formulations for a wider range of medications; addres- sing the speci\ufb01c needs of diverse patient populations (e.g., pediat- ric, elderly); optimizing the balance between ef\ufb01cacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness; and integrating advanced technologies for improved monitoring and adherence [25, 26]. Overcoming these obstacles is essential for advancing the \ufb01eld of inhaled therapeutics and improving patient outcomes across a spectrum of respiratory conditions. Novel drug delivery systems for the respiratory system have emerged as promising approaches to address the limitations of traditional methods. These innovative systems offer numerous advantages that signi\ufb01cantly enhance therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy and patient outcomes. 3.4 Enhanced Drug Deposition Ef\ufb01ciency Advanced delivery systems utilize sophisticated technologies to optimize particle size, shape, and aerodynamic properties, resulting in more precise and ef\ufb01cient drug deposition in the lungs [27]. This improved ef\ufb01ciency ensures that a higher percentage of the admi- nistered dose reaches the intended target sites, potentially reducing the required dosage and minimizing waste.", "Drug Delivery to the Respiratory System: Novel Approaches and Therapeutics 309 3.5 Improved Patient Compliance Through User-Friendly Devices Modern inhalation devices are designed with user-friendliness in mind and feature intuitive interfaces, simpli\ufb01ed operations, and clear instructions [28]. These improvements facilitate correct and consistent device usage, leading to better adherence to prescribed treatment regimens and improved overall therapeutic outcomes. 3.6 Targeted Delivery to Speci\ufb01c Lung Regions Novel delivery systems can be engineered to target speci\ufb01c regions of the respiratory tract, such as the upper airways, bronchi, and deep lung tissues [29]. This targeted approach allows for more precise treatment of localized conditions and potentially reduces systemic exposure to the drug, thus minimizing side effects. 3.7 Sustained- Release Formulations Innovative formulations incorporate controlled-release mechan- isms that allow prolonged drug action within the respiratory system [30, 31]. This sustained-release pro\ufb01le can reduce dosing fre- quency, improve patient convenience, and maintain therapeutic drug levels over extended periods, potentially enhancing treatment ef\ufb01cacy. 3.8 Enhanced Absorption by Overcoming Biological Barriers Advanced delivery systems are designed to overcome physiological barriers in the respiratory tract, such as mucus layers and epithelial tight junctions [32]. By addressing these obstacles, these systems can enhance drug absorption and bioavailability, leading to improved therapeutic effects. 3.9 Macromolecule Delivery Facilitation Novel approaches enable the effective delivery of large molecules, such as proteins, peptides, and nucleic acids, which have tradition- ally been challenging to administer via the respiratory route [33]. T", "cts. 3.9 Macromolecule Delivery Facilitation Novel approaches enable the effective delivery of large molecules, such as proteins, peptides, and nucleic acids, which have tradition- ally been challenging to administer via the respiratory route [33]. This capability expands the potential of inhalation therapy for the treatment of a wide range of respiratory diseases and sys- temic conditions. 3.10 Reduced Side Effects Through Improved Targeting By delivering drugs more precisely to the intended site of action within the respiratory system, these advanced systems can minimize drug exposure to non-target tissues [34, 35]. This targeted approach can signi\ufb01cantly reduce systemic side effects and improve the overall safety pro\ufb01le of respiratory medications. 3.11 Formulation Challenges Addressed Some drugs pose formulation challenges because of their physico- chemical properties or stability issues. Novel delivery systems offer innovative solutions to overcome these obstacles, enabling the development of inhalable drug formulations that were previously unsuitable for respiratory administration [36]. 3.12 Smart Technology Integration for Personalized Treatment Advanced delivery systems increasingly incorporate smart technol- ogies, such as sensors, data logging, and connectivity features. These innovations allow for real-time monitoring of patient adher- ence, lung function, and treatment ef\ufb01cacy, enabling healthcare", "providers to personalize and optimize treatment regimens based on individual patient needs and responses [37, 38]. 310 Pabbathi Shivakumar et al. 3.13 Environmental Sustainability Considerations Modern respiratory drug delivery systems that consider environ- mental considerations are being developed [39]. This includes the use of propellant-free devices, biodegradable materials, and designs that minimize waste and environmental impact, aligning with global efforts toward sustainability in healthcare. These innovative approaches to respiratory drug delivery sys- tems aim to overcome the limitations of traditional methods by addressing key challenges in drug administration, patient compli- ance, and treatment ef\ufb01cacy. By leveraging advanced technologies and formulation strategies, these novel systems have the potential to revolutionize respiratory medicine and offer more effective, convenient, and personalized treatment options for patients with a wide range of respiratory conditions. As research in this \ufb01eld continues to advance, further improvements in drug delivery tech- nologies are anticipated, leading to enhanced outcomes and quality of life in patients with respiratory diseases. 4 Novel Drug Delivery Approaches These novel approaches use innovative carrier systems designed to overcome the limitations of conventional drug delivery methods [40] (Table 1). 4.1 Nanoparticle- Based Delivery Nanoparticles, typically ranging from 1 to 100 nm in size, have emerged as versatile drug carriers for respiratory applications.

These proper- ties are advantageous for the delivery of lipophilic drugs. Inorganic nanoparticles: Materials such as gold, silver, and silica nanoparticles can be functionalized for drug delivery and imaging. They offer unique properties, such as surface plasmon resonance, for theranostic applications [43]. 3. Magnetic nanoparticles: These can be directed to speci\ufb01c lung regions using external magnetic \ufb01elds, enabling targeted drug delivery and potentially reducing systemic side effects [44].", "Drug Delivery to the Respiratory System: Novel Approaches and Therapeutics 311 Table 1 Comparison of traditional vs novel respiratory drug delivery methods Method Key features Advantages Limitations Typical applications Metered- dose inhalers (MDIs) Pressurized canister with propellant Delivers precise dose of aerosolized medication Portable and compact Rapid drug delivery Consistent dosing Requires coordination of actuation and inhalation Potential for oropharyngeal deposition Environmental concerns associated with propellants Asthma COPD Short-acting bronchodilators Dry powder inhalers (DPIs) Breath-actuated Delivers medication as dry powder Absence of propellants Breath-activated, facilitating ease of use Enhanced formulation stability Requires suf\ufb01cient inspiratory \ufb02ow Susceptibility to moisture Potential dose variability Asthma COPD Long-acting bronchodilators Inhaled corticosteroids Nebulizers Converts liquid medication to \ufb01ne mist Powered by compressed air or ultrasonic waves Suitable for diverse age groups and conditions Capable of delivering large doses No specialized breathing technique required Limited portability Extended administration time Risk of contamination Severe asthma/ COPD Cystic \ufb01brosis Delivery of antibiotics Nanoparticle- based delivery Utilizes engineered nanoparticles as drug carriers Can be polymer, lipid, or inorganic based Enhanced drug solubility and stability Improved cellular uptake Potential for targeted delivery Complex manufacturing processes Potential toxicity concerns Increased cost Gene therapy Targeted cancer treatments Sustained release formulations Smart inhalers Incorporates sensors and digital technology Tracks medication use and provides feedback Enhances adherence Enables remote monitoring Provides data on usage patterns Hig", " therapy Targeted cancer treatments Sustained release formulations Smart inhalers Incorporates sensors and digital technology Tracks medication use and provides feedback Enhances adherence Enables remote monitoring Provides data on usage patterns Higher cost Requires patient technological pro\ufb01ciency Privacy concerns Asthma/COPD management Clinical trials Personalized medicine (continued)", "Table 1 312 Pabbathi Shivakumar et al.

These include enhancing drug solubility and stability, thereby improving the bioavailability of poorly soluble drugs. Moreover, nanoparticles facilitate enhanced cellular uptake and intracellular delivery, enabling more ef\ufb01cient targeting of ther- apeutic agents to speci\ufb01c cells or tissues. The potential for sustained drug release from nanoparticles can result in prolonged therapeutic effects and reduced dosing frequency. Furthermore, nanoparticle systems possess the capability to co-deliver multiple therapeutic agents, enabling combination therapies and potentially synergistic effects. Additionally, nanoparticles can provide protection for drugs against degradation in the harsh lung environment, which is partic- ularly advantageous for pulmonary drug delivery applications [45] (Fig. 2). 4.2 Liposomal Formulations Liposomes are spherical vesicles composed of phospholipid bilayers that are capable of encapsulating both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs [46].

Liposomes have emerged as versatile and promising drug delivery systems, particularly for pulmonary applications. Their capacity to encapsulate a wide range of therapeutic agents, from small molecules to macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids, renders them adaptable to various treatment modal- ities [47]. This versatility is further enhanced by their ability to \ufb01ne- tune lipid composition, enabling optimized drug retention in the lungs. By modulating factors such as lipid chain length, saturation, and cholesterol content, researchers can design liposomes that persist in the pulmonary environment, potentially reducing dosing frequency and enhancing patient adherence. The potential for targeted delivery represents another signi\ufb01- cant advantage of liposomal systems for pulmonary drug delivery. Through surface modi\ufb01cation with speci\ufb01c ligands or antibodies, liposomes can be engineered to selectively bind to speci\ufb01c cell types or tissues within the lungs [48]. This targeted approach not only", "enhances therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy by concentrating the drug at the desired site of action but also contributes to reduced systemic toxicity. By minimizing drug exposure to healthy tissues, liposomal formulations can potentially mitigate the adverse effects associated with conventional drug delivery methods, thereby improving the overall safety pro\ufb01le of pulmonary therapies. These combined attri- butes make liposomes a powerful tool for addressing the challenges of lung-speci\ufb01c drug delivery, offering the potential for more ef\ufb01- cacious and well-tolerated treatments for various respiratory conditions. Drug Delivery to the Respiratory System: Novel Approaches and Therapeutics 313 Fig. 2 Illustration of nanoparticle-based drug carriers interacting with lung epithelial cells 4.3 Polymer-Based Carriers Polymer-based carriers have emerged as versatile platforms for respiratory drug delivery, offering distinctive properties that enhance controlled drug release and improve bioavailability [49]. Natural polymers, such as alginate, chitosan, and hyaluronic acid, exhibit biocompatibility and can form hydrogels for sustained drug release [50]. Synthetic polymers such as poly(lactic acid) (PLA), poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL), and polyethylene glycol (PEG) provide adjustable degradation rates and customizable release pro\ufb01les [51]. Advanced stimuli-responsive polymers react to environmental cues, such as pH, temperature, or enzymes, enabling targeted drug release in speci\ufb01c lung regions or disease conditions.

Furthermore, dendrimers and dendrigraft poly- mers, characterized by their highly branched tree-like structures, offer unique advantages for respiratory drug delivery, thereby expanding the potential of polymer-based carriers in this \ufb01eld.", "314 Pabbathi Shivakumar et al. Dendrimers present several advantages for pulmonary drug delivery owing to their unique structural properties. Their multi- functionality, characterized by numerous surface groups, enables the simultaneous attachment of drugs, targeting ligands, and imag- ing agents, thereby facilitating versatile therapeutic approaches [53]. The controlled size and structure of dendrimers, achieved through precise manipulation of dendrimer generation, allows for tailored drug loading and release properties, thereby optimizing delivery ef\ufb01ciency. Moreover, dendrimers can enhance the solubil- ity of poorly water-soluble drugs through encapsulation or surface complexation, thereby addressing a common challenge in drug formulation. Certain dendrimers have demonstrated the capacity to enhance drug transport across lung epithelial barriers, improve transepithelial transport, and potentially increase drug bioavailabil- ity [54]. For example, polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers have been shown to enhance the permeability of inhaled corticos- teroids across airway epithelial cells. Additionally, cationic dendri- mers can form complexes with nucleic acids, facilitating ef\ufb01cient gene delivery into lung cells [55]. This property has been utilized in the development of dendrimer-based carriers for siRNA delivery for the treatment of lung cancers and in\ufb02ammatory lung diseases. Exosomes and extracellular vesicles have emerged as promising naturally occurring nanocarriers for targeted drug and gene deliv- ery, particularly in pulmonary therapeutics [56].

Furthermore, engineered exo- somes loaded with siRNA have exhibited successful gene silencing in lung cancer cells, highlighting their potential for oncological applications [57]. Their ability to traverse biological barriers and theranostic potential further enhances their utility in developing innovative pulmonary therapies (Table 2). These novel drug delivery approaches offer promising solutions for enhancing the ef\ufb01cacy and safety of respiratory therapy. Ongo- ing research is focused on optimizing these systems for speci\ufb01c lung diseases and developing combination strategies to maximize thera- peutic outcomes. 5 Advanced Inhalation Devices Inhalation devices have advanced signi\ufb01cantly, revolutionizing the delivery of respiratory medications.

The inhalation-activated trigger mechanism typically employs a spring-loaded pneumatic system, whereas a \ufb02ow sensor detects the initiation of inhalation using pressure differential or hot-wire anemometry.

Advanced features, such as variable \ufb02ow rate trigger- ing, multiple-dose reservoirs, and integrated dose counters, further enhance their functionality. These devices adapt to diverse patient breathing patterns, enable extended use without frequent reload- ing, and monitor the remaining doses to alert users when replen- ishment is necessary. 316 Pabbathi Shivakumar et al. Soft mist inhalers (SMIs) generate slow-moving, long-lasting aerosol clouds to improve lung deposition [59]. These devices utilize liquid formulations, typically aqueous or ethanolic solutions of the medication. A compressed spring mechanism serves as the mechanical energy source, and a unique uniblock design with precision-drilled nozzles forms the nozzle system. A dose-metering chamber ensured accurate and consistent dose delivery. The mechanism of action of soft mist inhalers involves dose preparation, energy storage, nozzle alignment, forced impinge- ment, and aerosol generation. These devices offer several technical advantages, including particle size control, low-velocity aerosol production, extended spray duration, high \ufb01ne particle fraction, and propellant-free design. Advanced features, such as dose-release lock-out, integrated dose counters, and ergonomic design, further enhance their usability and ef\ufb01cacy.

The following three innovative methods are aimed at improving the speci\ufb01city of drug delivery: receptor-mediated targeting, pH-responsive drug release, and magnetic \ufb01eld-guided delivery.", "Drug Delivery to the Respiratory System: Novel Approaches and Therapeutics 317 Fig. 3 Diagram showing structure and components of a smart inhaler device 6.1 Receptor- Mediated Targeting Receptor-mediated targeting is a sophisticated approach that uti- lizes speci\ufb01c receptors on lung cells to achieve targeted drug deliv- ery. This method employs ligands, which are molecules designed to bind to particular receptors, thereby facilitating drug uptake by speci\ufb01c cell types [60]. This process commences with the identi\ufb01cation of receptors that are overexpressed or uniquely present in target cells in the lungs. Common targets include cell surface proteins, such as integ- rins, growth factor receptors, and cell adhesion molecules. Follow- ing their identi\ufb01cation, ligands are either synthesized or selected from existing molecules that demonstrate high af\ufb01nity and speci\ufb01c- ity for these receptors. These ligands are subsequently conjugated to drug carriers, such as nanoparticles, liposomes, or polymeric micelles. Upon administration, these drug-ligand complexes circulate in the blood- stream until they encounter their target receptors in the lungs. Upon binding, the complexes are internalized by cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis, effectively delivering the drug payload. Receptor-mediated targeting has several advantages. This enables increased drug concentration at the target site, reducing systemic exposure and potential side effects [61]. This approach also enhances the therapeutic index of drugs by improving their bioavailability and cellular uptake. Furthermore, it can overcome certain biological barriers, such as the blood-air barrier in the lungs, which often impedes conventional drug delivery methods.", "bility and cellular uptake. Furthermore, it can overcome certain biological barriers, such as the blood-air barrier in the lungs, which often impedes conventional drug delivery methods.", "318 Pabbathi Shivakumar et al. However, challenges remain in the implementation of receptor- mediated targeting. These include the necessity for extensive research to identify suitable receptor-ligand pairs, potential immu- nogenicity of the targeting ligands, and the complexity of manufacturing these sophisticated drug delivery systems at scale. 6.2 pH-Responsive Drug Release pH-responsive drug release is an intelligent drug delivery strategy that capitalizes on pH variations within different regions of the lungs or under speci\ufb01c disease conditions. This approach involves designing drug carriers that remain stable at physiological pH but undergo structural changes or degradation in response to altera- tions in the local pH, thereby releasing their drug payload. The lungs exhibit natural pH gradients, with the airways typi- cally having a slightly acidic pH (6.0\u20136.5) compared to the more neutral pH of the alveoli (7.0\u20137.4). Moreover, certain pathological conditions, such as in\ufb02ammation, infection, and cancer, can further alter the local pH. pH-responsive drug delivery systems have been designed to exploit these differences for targeted drug release [62]. These systems typically employ pH-sensitive polymers or lipids that undergo conformational changes or hydrolysis in response to speci\ufb01c pH conditions. Polymers with weakly acidic or basic groups can be used for this purpose. In acidic environments, these poly- mers swell or dissolve, thereby releasing the encapsulated drugs. Conversely, they remain stable in neutral or alkaline environments, thereby preventing premature drug release. Common pH-responsive materials include poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and its derivatives, chitosan and its derivatives, poly(histi- dine), and pH-sensitive lipids such as phosphatidylethanolamin", "ine environments, thereby preventing premature drug release. Common pH-responsive materials include poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and its derivatives, chitosan and its derivatives, poly(histi- dine), and pH-sensitive lipids such as phosphatidylethanolamine. These materials exhibit changes in their properties or behavior in response to variations in pH, making them valuable for various applications in \ufb01elds like drug delivery, biosensors, and smart materials. The design of these systems can be further re\ufb01ned to respond to speci\ufb01c pH ranges, allowing for precise control of drug release in different lung regions or under particular disease conditions. For example, a drug carrier designed to release its payload at pH 6.5 could target in\ufb02amed lung tissue, whereas one that is stable at this pH but responsive to more acidic conditions (pH < 6.0) could target areas of severe in\ufb02ammation or infection. pH-responsive drug release systems offer numerous advantages in pharmaceutical applications. This approach enables precise spa- tial control of drug release, facilitating targeted delivery to speci\ufb01c anatomical regions. By implementing this strategy, systemic toxicity is mitigated through the reduction of drug exposure to healthy tissues. Moreover, pH-responsive systems have the potential to enhance therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy by releasing pharmaceutical agents in response to disease-speci\ufb01c pH alterations, thereby ensuring opti- mal drug concentrations at the intended site of action.", "Furthermore, this methodology provides a protective mechanism for pH-sensitive drugs, shielding them from degradation as they transit through diverse physiological environments. Collectively, these bene\ufb01ts contribute to improved drug ef\ufb01cacy and safety pro\ufb01les in therapeutic interventions. Drug Delivery to the Respiratory System: Novel Approaches and Therapeutics 319 However, the challenges of this approach include the complex- ity of designing systems with appropriate pH sensitivity and the potential for variability in local pH conditions among patients or disease states. 6.3 Magnetic Field- Guided Delivery Magnetic \ufb01eld-guided delivery is an innovative approach that com- bines nanotechnology with external magnetic \ufb01elds to direct drugs to speci\ufb01c lung areas [63]. This method offers a unique opportu- nity for the spatial control of drug delivery, potentially improving therapeutic outcomes while minimizing off-target effects. The core component of this strategy involves the utilization of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), primarily composed of iron oxide (e.g., magnetite or maghemite), owing to their biocompatibility and superparamagnetic properties [64]. MNPs are either incorporated with pharmaceutical agents or function as constitu- ents of more intricate drug delivery systems, such as liposomes or polymeric nanoparticles. The magnetic \ufb01eld-guided delivery pro- cess encompasses several stages: drug incorporation, administra- tion, magnetic guidance, retention, and drug release. The intensity and duration of the applied magnetic \ufb01eld can be modu- lated to optimize drug targeting and retention with advanced con- \ufb01gurations employing multiple magnets or electromagnetic systems to generate complex \ufb01eld patterns and achieve precise targeting. Magnetic \ufb01eld-guided delivery pre", "ic \ufb01eld can be modu- lated to optimize drug targeting and retention with advanced con- \ufb01gurations employing multiple magnets or electromagnetic systems to generate complex \ufb01eld patterns and achieve precise targeting. Magnetic \ufb01eld-guided delivery presents several advantages, includ- ing non-invasive spatial control of drug distribution, potential for deep tissue targeting within the pulmonary system, reduced sys- temic drug exposure, possibility of repeated treatments without additional invasive procedures, and integration with imaging tech- niques for theranostic applications [65, 66]. However, this approach faces challenges such as limited penetration depth of magnetic \ufb01elds, potential for MNP aggregation, requirement for specialized equipment and trained personnel, and complexity in scaling up the production of stable, uniform magnetic drug carriers [67, 68]. Ongoing research in this \ufb01eld is focused on developing more powerful and precisely controllable magnetic systems, improving the stability and biocompatibility of magnetic carriers, and explor- ing their combination with other targeting strategies to enhance their ef\ufb01cacy. These targeted drug delivery strategies represent signi\ufb01cant advances in pulmonary therapy. Each approach has unique advan- tages and presents distinct challenges. As research progresses, it is", "likely that combinations of these strategies or entirely new approaches will emerge, further revolutionizing the landscape of targeted drug delivery to the lungs. 320 Pabbathi Shivakumar et al. 7 Emerging Therapeutics for Respiratory Diseases Gene therapy for pulmonary diseases uses diverse vector systems to deliver therapeutic genes to target cells [69]. Viral vectors, includ- ing adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), lentiviruses, and adeno- viruses, are frequently employed owing to their ef\ufb01cacy in cell transduction. AAVs are preferred for pulmonary applications because of their low immunogenicity and capacity for long-term gene expression [70]. Non-viral vectors, such as lipid nanoparticles and polymer-based systems, offer enhanced safety pro\ufb01les and tar- geted delivery capabilities [71]. Physical methods, including elec- troporation and sonoporation, can facilitate localized gene transfer [72]. Nevertheless, gene therapy for lung diseases presents several challenges, including overcoming mucus barriers in the airways, achieving sustained gene expression, and targeting speci\ufb01c cell types within the pulmonary system [73]. Ongoing research endea- vors are aimed at addressing these obstacles and enhancing the ef\ufb01cacy of pulmonary gene therapy. siRNA and antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are sophisticated tools for modulating gene expression in respiratory diseases. siRNA comprises double-stranded RNA molecules that induce mRNA degradation, whereas antisense oligonucleotides are single- stranded DNA/RNA molecules that bind to the target mRNA, thereby inhibiting translation or inducing degradation [74]. Vari- ous delivery strategies have been developed to enhance the ef\ufb01cacy of these molecules, including inhalation for direct lung delivery, conjugation with cell-penetrating p", " target mRNA, thereby inhibiting translation or inducing degradation [74]. Vari- ous delivery strategies have been developed to enhance the ef\ufb01cacy of these molecules, including inhalation for direct lung delivery, conjugation with cell-penetrating peptides to improve cellular uptake, and nanoparticle formulations to protect nucleic acids from degradation [75]. These approaches have demonstrated potential in targeting in\ufb02ammatory mediators in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), silencing onco- genes in pulmonary malignancies, and modulating host-pathogen interactions in respiratory infections [76]. Cell-based therapies for lung diseases encompass diverse stem cell types, including mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with anti- in\ufb02ammatory and immunomodulatory properties, induced plurip- otent stem cells (iPSCs) for generating patient-speci\ufb01c lung cells, and lung-resident progenitor cells that promote endogenous repair mechanisms [77, 78]. These therapies operate through multiple mechanisms, such as paracrine effects involving the secretion of growth factors and anti-in\ufb02ammatory molecules, cell replacement through differentiation into functional pulmonary cell types, and immunomodulation by regulating in\ufb02ammatory responses.", "Drug Delivery to the Respiratory System: Novel Approaches and Therapeutics 321 Applications of cell-based therapies include the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) by attenuating in\ufb02am- mation and promoting tissue repair, reversal of \ufb01brotic changes, restoration of pulmonary function in pulmonary \ufb01brosis, and the development of personalized therapeutic approaches for cystic \ufb01brosis using gene-corrected stem cells. However, several challenges persist in the \ufb01eld, including opti- mization of cell delivery and engraftment in the pulmonary system, enhancement of long-term survival and function of transplanted cells, and development of combination therapies that integrate gene therapy and cell-based approaches. Addressing these chal- lenges is crucial for advancing cell-based therapies for lung diseases. 8 Novel Formulations for Improved Drug Ef\ufb01cacy In pharmaceutical research, innovative drug formulations are being developed to enhance therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy by addressing key chal- lenges, such as poor solubility, limited bioavailability, and adverse effects. Researchers are employing advanced technologies and materials to create sophisticated delivery systems that optimize drug release, improve targeting precision, and enhance patient compliance 8.1 Controlled- Release Formulations Controlled-release formulations for pulmonary drug delivery encompass diverse, innovative approaches. Polymeric microparti- cles, speci\ufb01cally those fabricated from biodegradable poly(lactic-co- glycolic acid) (PLGA), encapsulate therapeutic agents for sustained release over extended durations, maintaining therapeutic concen- trations while concurrently reducing dosing frequency and adverse effects [79, 80]. Liposomes, phospholipid vesicles capable of entrapping both hydrophilic ", "apeutic agents for sustained release over extended durations, maintaining therapeutic concen- trations while concurrently reducing dosing frequency and adverse effects [79, 80]. Liposomes, phospholipid vesicles capable of entrapping both hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds, offer prolonged release pro\ufb01les and enhanced lung retention [81]. Nano- carriers, including solid lipid nanoparticles and dendrimers, facili- tate improved lung deposition and drug solubility, while providing protection against enzymatic degradation [82, 83]. In situ forming gels utilize temperature- or pH-responsive polymers that generate a depot for sustained drug release upon inhalation, thereby extend- ing the residence time within the pulmonary environment. Mucoadhesive systems employing polymers, such as chitosan, adhere to lung mucus, thereby increasing drug contact time and absorption [84]. These formulations can be further optimized by incorporating enzyme inhibitors or permeation enhancers to enhance drug bioavailability, thereby collectively advancing the \ufb01eld of pulmonary drug delivery.", "322 Pabbathi Shivakumar et al. 8.2 Combination Therapies Advancements in pulmonary drug delivery have led to innovative strategies for the co-administration of multiple therapeutic agents into the lungs. These approaches aim to enhance ef\ufb01cacy, improve adherence, and optimize delivery under complex respiratory conditions [85]. Fixed-dose combinations, nanoparticle-based co-delivery sys- tems, layer-by-layer assembly techniques, dual-action prodrugs, and complementary formulations represent innovative approaches for multi-drug delivery in inhaled therapeutics. These strategies offer distinct advantages, such as simplifying administration, enhancing patient adherence, and improving therapeutic outcomes for complex respiratory diseases. Fixed-dose combinations co-formulate multiple drugs in a single inhaler, whereas nanoparticle-based systems encapsulate drugs to achieve synergistic effects and targeted delivery [86]. Layer-by-layer assembly enables tailored release pro\ufb01les through sequential drug-layer deposition, and dual-action prodrugs release two active compounds upon enzymatic cleavage in the lungs [87]. Complementary formulations optimize lung deposition and absorption by combining drugs with different physicochemical properties. Each approach addresses spe- ci\ufb01c challenges in inhaled drug delivery, potentially revolutionizing the treatment of respiratory conditions by enhancing ef\ufb01cacy, patient compliance, and overall therapeutic outcomes. 8.3 Prodrug Approaches Prodrug strategies offer promising solutions for pulmonary drug delivery challenges by modifying the physicochemical properties of drugs to enhance their absorption, distribution, and ef\ufb01cacy in the lungs [88]. This approach aims to optimize drug performance in pulmonary applications, potentially improving ", " drug delivery challenges by modifying the physicochemical properties of drugs to enhance their absorption, distribution, and ef\ufb01cacy in the lungs [88]. This approach aims to optimize drug performance in pulmonary applications, potentially improving treatments for respi- ratory diseases. 1. Ester Prodrugs: These formulations improve lipophilicity and membrane permeability, enhancing cellular uptake and bio- availability. By converting polar functional groups into esters, the lipophilicity of drugs can be increased, facilitating their passage through cell membranes [89]. Once inside the cell, esterases cleave the prodrug and release the active compound. This approach is particularly useful for improving the delivery of hydrophilic drugs with poor membrane permeability. 2. Phosphate Prodrugs: Increased water solubility facilitates improved dissolution and absorption in the lung \ufb02uid. Phos- phate groups are added to poorly water-soluble drugs to enhance their aqueous solubility. In the lung environment, phosphatases cleave phosphate groups to release the parent drug. This strategy is bene\ufb01cial for drugs with limited solubility in lung \ufb02uid because it can improve their dissolution and subsequent absorption [90].", "Drug Delivery to the Respiratory System: Novel Approaches and Therapeutics 323 3. Enzyme-Activated Prodrugs: Utilization of lung-speci\ufb01c enzymes enables site-speci\ufb01c drug activation and reduces sys- temic side effects. These prodrugs are designed to be activated by enzymes that are predominantly expressed in lung tissues [91]. This approach allows targeted drug release in the lungs while minimizing activation and potential side effects in other tissues. Enzyme-activated prodrugs can improve the therapeu- tic index of drugs by concentrating their activity at the desired site of action. 4. PEGylation: Attachment of polyethylene glycol chains increases drug stability and circulation time. PEGylation involves covalent attachment of polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules to drugs or drug carriers. In pulmonary delivery, PEGylation can enhance the stability of drugs in lung \ufb02uids, reduce immunogenicity, and prolong their retention in the lungs [92]. This approach is particularly useful for protein and peptide drugs that are susceptible to rapid clearance or degradation. 5. Amino Acid Conjugates: These formulations enhance drug stability and target-speci\ufb01c transporters in lung epithelial cells for improved absorption [93]. By conjugating drugs with amino acids, it is possible to exploit active transport mechan- isms in lung epithelial cells. This strategy can improve the absorption of drugs that typically have poor permeability across lung membranes. Additionally, amino acid conjugation can enhance the stability of certain drugs in the lung environment, thereby protecting them from enzymatic degradation. 9 Personalized Medicine in Respiratory Drug Delivery Customization of treatment for individual patients through phar- macogenomics. It investigates genetic variations in drug- me", "e lung environment, thereby protecting them from enzymatic degradation. 9 Personalized Medicine in Respiratory Drug Delivery Customization of treatment for individual patients through phar- macogenomics. It investigates genetic variations in drug- metabolizing enzymes, speci\ufb01cally cytochrome P450 enzymes (e.g., CYP2D6 and CYP3A4), which in\ufb02uence the metabolism of inhaled corticosteroids and beta-2 agonists [94]. For example, patients with the CYP2D6 poor metabolizer genotype may require lower doses of salbutamol to minimize adverse effects. Further- more, genetic variations in drug targets, such as beta-2 adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) polymorphisms, affect the response to beta- 2 agonists. Patients with the Arg16 variant of ADRB2 may demon- strate a diminished response to albuterol compared to those with the Gly16 variant [95]. Pharmacogenomic testing, which includes genotyping patients using saliva samples to determine their CYP2D6 genotype before prescribing inhaled corticosteroids, is used to identify relevant polymorphisms [96]. These", "pharmacogenomic applications facilitate personalized treatments, such as prescribing higher doses of formoterol to patients with the Gly16 variant of ADRB2 to achieve optimal bronchodilation. 324 Pabbathi Shivakumar et al. 9.1 Biomarker- Guided Therapy Biomarker-guided therapy for respiratory diseases employs diverse biomarker types to inform treatment decisions and optimize patient care. Molecular biomarkers, including eosinophil count, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), and serum periostin, play pivotal roles in guiding therapy selection and predicting treatment responses [97]. For example, blood eosinophil counts are used to guide anti-IL-5 therapy in severe asthma, with mepolizumab recommended for patients with counts \u2265300 cells/\u03bcL. Serum peri- ostin levels exceeding 50 ng/mL can assist in identifying patients with severe asthma who have a higher likelihood of responding to lebrikizumab. Consistent monitoring of biomarkers, such as lung function and symptom scores, facilitates treatment optimization. As an illustration, inhaled corticosteroid doses may be adjusted based on FeNO levels surpassing 50 ppb in patients with asthma. Emerging biomarkers, such as exhaled breath condensate analysis, present novel approaches for assessing airway in\ufb02ammation, with pH levels in condensates serving as indicators of airway acidity in patients with COPD [98]. The incorporation of multiple biomar- kers into composite scores, combining molecular and clinical mar- kers, has the potential to enhance the prediction of outcomes, including exacerbation risk in asthma patients (Table 3). The personalized medicine approach to respiratory drug deliv- ery faces challenges in standardizing biomarker measurements, developing point-of-care testing, and integrating pharmacoge- nomic data in", "ng exacerbation risk in asthma patients (Table 3). The personalized medicine approach to respiratory drug deliv- ery faces challenges in standardizing biomarker measurements, developing point-of-care testing, and integrating pharmacoge- nomic data into clinical decision support systems. Large-scale clini- cal trials are needed to validate these approaches while addressing cost-effectiveness and accessibility. Despite these challenges, incor- porating pharmacogenomics and biomarker-guided therapy into personalized respiratory medicine shows promise in improving patient outcomes, reducing adverse effects, and optimizing resource utilization in respiratory disease management. 10 Future Perspectives and Emerging Technologies The \ufb01eld of respiratory drug delivery is advancing rapidly, driven by innovative technologies aimed at enhancing therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy, patient adherence, and addressing delivery challenges. Develop- ments in nanotechnology, smart inhalers, and targeted delivery systems have revolutionized respiratory medication administration. Ongoing research on novel approaches promises more personalized and ef\ufb01cient treatments for various pulmonary disorders, offering opportunities to overcome current limitations and improve patient outcomes.", "Drug Delivery to the Respiratory System: Novel Approaches and Therapeutics 325 Table 3 Summary of key biomarkers used in personalized medicine for respiratory diseases Biomarker name Associated respiratory condition Measurement method Clinical signi\ufb01cance Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) Asthma Breath test Indicates eosinophilic airway in\ufb02ammation; guides corticosteroid treatment Blood eosinophil count Asthma, COPD Blood test Predicts response to inhaled corticosteroids and biologics Periostin Asthma Blood test Indicates Th2-high asthma; predicts response to anti-IL-13 therapy Alpha-1 antitrypsin COPD Blood test Identi\ufb01es alpha-1 antitrypsin de\ufb01ciency; guides augmentation therapy EGFR mutations Lung cancer Tissue biopsy, liquid biopsy Predicts response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors ALK rearrangements Lung cancer Tissue biopsy, immunohistochemistry Predicts response to ALK inhibitors PD-L1 expression Lung cancer Immunohistochemistry Predicts response to immune checkpoint inhibitors KRAS mutations Lung cancer Tissue biopsy, liquid biopsy Associated with poor prognosis; guides treatment selection Sputum neutrophil count Bronchiectasis Sputum analysis Indicates neutrophilic in\ufb02ammation; guides antibiotic therapy Serum IgE levels Allergic asthma Blood test Predicts response to anti-IgE therapy (e.g., omalizumab) IL-5 levels Eosinophilic asthma Blood test Predicts response to anti-IL-5 therapy (e.g., mepolizumab) CFTR mutations Cystic \ufb01brosis Genetic testing Con\ufb01rms diagnosis; guides CFTR modulator therapy selection 10.1 3D-Printed Inhalers Additive manufacturing techniques present signi\ufb01cant potential for the development of patient-speci\ufb01c inhaler designs, enabling pre- cise control of device geometry and functionality [99].

The inte- gration of computational \ufb02uid dynamics (CFD) allows for the optimization of air\ufb02ow patterns and particle deposition within the inhaler, thereby enhancing drug delivery ef\ufb01ciency. This approach facilitates the customization of dose chamber volumes, mouthpiece geometries, and actuation mechanisms to address individual patient requirements and preferences. Moreover, 3D printing technology offers the possibility of incorporating sensors and electronic", "components, enabling smart inhaler functionality, such as dose tracking, adherence monitoring, and real-time feedback [100]. The rapid prototyping and iterative design capabilities inher- ent to additive manufacturing expedite the development of innova- tive inhaler concepts, while also enabling the production of complex internal structures that enhance drug dispersion and min- imize waste. Furthermore, this technology permits the creation of lightweight ergonomic designs that enhance patient comfort and usability. 326 Pabbathi Shivakumar et al. Nevertheless, several challenges persist, including ensuring material biocompatibility, long-term stability of printed compo- nents, scalability for mass production, and navigating regulatory approval processes for novel manufacturing methods. To fully capi- talize on the potential of 3D-printed inhalers, it is necessary to develop specialized software tools for design optimization and quality control, as well as conduct research on new materials that satisfy both 3D printing requirements and pharmaceutical-grade standards. 10.2 Arti\ufb01cial Intelligence in Drug Delivery Arti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI) is transforming the \ufb01eld of drug delivery through its diverse applications. Machine learning algorithms ana- lyze extensive datasets to predict drug-excipient interactions and stability, thereby enhancing formulation development ef\ufb01ciency. Deep learning models optimize particle size distributions and aero- dynamic properties, thus improving inhaled drug formulation per- formance.

AI-driven pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling enables personalized dosing regimens, maximizing ther- apeutic ef\ufb01cacy while minimizing adverse effects [101]. Reinforce- ment learning algorithms optimize drug delivery device designs, enhancing usability, and patient adherence. Computer vision tech- niques enable automated quality control in manufacturing pro- cesses, ensuring consistency in the appearance and performance of drug products [102]. AI-powered predictive maintenance systems reduce equipment downtime and improve production ef\ufb01ciency. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) simulate and predict the long-term stability of drug formulations, potentially reducing the need for extended stability studies [103]. AI algorithms analyze real-time patient data from smart inhalers, thereby enabling the development of adaptive treatment strategies. Challenges include ensuring data quality and representativeness, improving model interpretability for regulatory compliance, integrating AI systems with existing pharmaceutical processes, and mitigating potential biases in the training data. The successful implementation of AI in drug delivery necessitates interdisciplinary collaboration among data scientists, pharmaceutical researchers, and regulatory experts.", "Drug Delivery to the Respiratory System: Novel Approaches and Therapeutics 327 10.3 Organ-on-a- Chip Models Organ-on-a-chip models are advanced micro\ufb02uidic devices that mimic human organs and provide a more physiologically relevant environment for drug testing [104]. They incorporate multiple cell types, 3D structures, and mechanical forces to replicate in vivo conditions. These models enable high-throughput screening of inhaled therapeutics, potentially reducing animal studies and offer- ing opportunities for personalized medicine using patient-derived cells. These models allow real-time monitoring of cellular responses, investigation of organ-speci\ufb01c drug metabolism and toxicity, and examination of drug-drug interactions. These results support the development of novel drug delivery systems and chronic exposure studies. Organ-on-a-chip models also facilitate the creation of disease models for testing targeted therapies [105]. Challenges include the standardization of protocols, scal- ability, and establishing correlations with in vivo results. They require specialized imaging techniques, data analysis methods, and interdisciplinary collaboration for the effective design and interpretation of experiments (Table 4). 11 Conclusion Recent advancements in respiratory drug delivery, including smart inhalers, nanoparticle formulations, and targeted delivery systems, have enhanced treatment ef\ufb01cacy and precision. The integration of digital health solutions and arti\ufb01cial intelligence has facilitated personalized medicine and real-time adherence monitoring, thereby improving patient-care outcomes.

The new molecular and genetic knowledge of CVD is ever-expanding; consequently, this has brought about the innovation of cell and molecular therapies that carry hope for treatment. Advanced approaches have been employed to enhance the effectiveness and the period of these therapies, some of which involve new agents alongside biological ones. Targeted drug delivery to the cardiovascular system, in particular, is seen to hold much promise with several main advantages. This approach enables a more precise and effective delivery of therapeutic drugs directly to the heart and blood vessels, enhancing treatment outcomes while minimizing undesirable side effects. However, at the same time, there remains several impediments that have to be addressed to realize the formulation of effective systems for the delivery of drugs to the cardiovascular system. Work actively ongoing in Cardio- vascular Drug Delivery Specialty Section aims to do these in order to help these new approaches enter the clinics. These efforts aim to ultimately reduce the global burden of cardiovascular diseases. Also, there is a need to conduct additional research for the improvement of the design and structure of drug delivery systems as well as the external factors applied in the control of drug delivery within the body so that the therapies would be maximally ef\ufb01cient and safe with few undesirable effects.

The cardiovascular system plays an important role in maintaining overall health. The disruption of the system can result in the development of CVD such as atherosclerosis, myocar- dial infarction, and small blood vessel disease. A major risk factor for CVD is high blood pressure, also known as essential hyperten- sion. When considering the severity of symptoms Developing Abhishek Pathak and Satya Pal Singh (eds.), Next-Generation Drug Delivery Systems, Methods in Pharmacology and Toxicology, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-4554-3_15, \u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025 335", "effective treatments for CVD has therefore become a top priority. Rapid advances in nanoscience and the unique properties of nano- materials have brought nanotechnology as a promising solution to the challenge of treating cardiovascular diseases. Nano-drug deliv- ery systems (NDDS), a type of nanomaterial, offer several advan- tages in drug delivery. These systems can increase drug stability and water solubility, extend circulation time, improve absorption by target cells or tissues, and reduce the degradation of enzymes This increases the safety and ef\ufb01cacy of drugs used to treat CVD [2, 3]. 336 Pankaj Kumar Umar et al. Nano-drug delivery systems (NDDS) can be administered through multiple routes, such as inhalation, oral administration, or intravenous injection, and improving drug absorption. In the past few years, researchers are increasingly interested in developing nanomedicine carrier systems for the diagnosis and treatment of heart diseases, and concerns about the potential risks of exposure associated with these materials are also increasing. When you touch more, nanomaterials are also more likely to interact with blood vessels, blood, and their components. This may have a signi\ufb01cant impact on human health [4]. Giving medicines and other medical substances, it has been an important foundation of modern medicine for a long time. Accord- ing to the theory, various diseases arise due to the presence of abnormal or diseased cells within otherwise healthy organs and tissues. Drugs must hit a speci\ufb01c target molecule in order to be effective. However, all drugs are inherently toxic to some degree. This may restrict the safe dosage and consequently reduce the drug\u2019s treatment ef\ufb01cacy in order to minimize the risk of side effects. It is important to target drugs directly", "er to be effective. However, all drugs are inherently toxic to some degree. This may restrict the safe dosage and consequently reduce the drug\u2019s treatment ef\ufb01cacy in order to minimize the risk of side effects. It is important to target drugs directly to diseased organs and cells. To achieve this goal, drug delivery systems (DDS) play an important role in enhancing the safety and ef\ufb01cacy of therapeutic agents. Recent integration has led to the development of nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems (nano-DDS). These sys- tems can modify the behavior of medical and diagnostic substances within the body. One of its main objectives is to modify the kinetics in the body to improve effectiveness [5]. Nano-drug delivery systems (nano-DDS) can be fabricated using materials and structures. Nano-drug delivery systems (nano-DDS) can be designed using various materials and struc- tures, including lipids for forming micelles or liposomes, polymers, dendrimers, carbon nanotubes, iron oxide crystals, gold nanopar- ticles, and other metallic nanoparticles [6]. In this section, we highlight speci\ufb01c examples of nanoscale materials that have been evaluated as nanodrug delivery systems (nano-DDS), for example, micelles formed from synthetic amphiphilic molecules, such as lipids and polysaccharides [7]. Micelles naturally self-assemble in aqueous environments and can encapsulate hydrophobic therapeu- tic agents, helping to address solubility challenges. Their size", "typically ranges from 10 to 100 nanometers in diameter, with more con\ufb01ned internal spaces compared to liposomes. Liposomes, pri- marily composed of phospholipids that form bilayer structures with an internal aqueous compartment, vary in size, often spanning from a few hundred to several thousand nanometers in diameter. Among nano-drug delivery systems (nano-DDS), liposomes have been the most extensively studied in both basic and clinical research, with approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). They can incorporate a variety of substances, including chemicals, nucleotides, and crystalline metals [8]. Drug Delivery to the Cardiovascular System: Application and Future Prospects 337 At present, two polymers, polylactide (PLA) and poly(lactide- co-glycolide) (PLGA), are utilized in the synthesis of FDA-approved biodegradable polymeric nano-drug delivery sys- tems (nano-DDS). PLGA polymers are capable of encapsulating both hydrophilic and hydrophobic therapeutic agents, such as che- micals and nucleotides, through emulsion solvent diffusion techni- ques. These systems are being investigated for the treatment of challenging diseases, including cardiovascular conditions [9]. Den- drimers are highly branched macromolecules featuring a precisely controlled, nearly monodisperse, three-dimensional structure that radiates from a central core. Polymer growth begins at this central core and expands outward through successive polymerization reac- tions, which determine the overall size of the dendrimers, typically starting at a few nanometers. The core\u2019s cavities, along with the folding of the branches, form cages and channels that can encapsu- late therapeutic agents [10].

The core\u2019s cavities, along with the folding of the branches, form cages and channels that can encapsu- late therapeutic agents [10]. Carbon nanotubes, a type of fullerene, are composed of graphite sheets rolled into tubular structures. The diameter of single-walled nanotubes typically ranges from 0.5 to 3.0 nanometers, while their length can vary from 20 to 1000 nanometers. Therapeutic agents can be attached to either the inner or outer surfaces of the nanotube walls, referred to as \ufb01lling or wrapping modes of binding, respectively [11]. In contrast, metallic nanoparticles possess inherent functional- ity. Iron oxides are typically synthesized through an alkaline co-precipitation process involving Fe2+ and Fe3+ salts in an aqueous solution, along with a suitable hydrophilic polymer such as dextran or poly(ethylene glycol). This method produces an iron core with a diameter of approximately 4\u20135 nanometers, characterized by a hexagonal shape. Surrounding this iron core, dextran or poly(eth- ylene glycol) molecules form a protective layer, resulting in the creation of superparamagnetic iron oxide particles (SPIO), which range from 60 to 150 nanometers in size. These SPIO particles serve as effective contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), enhancing the visibility of tissues and structures within the body during imaging procedures [12]. Gold nanoparticles exhibit unique photodynamic properties, allowing them to absorb near- infrared light and subsequently emit both light and heat. These characteristics have been explored for use in cancer photothermal", " characteristics have been explored for use in cancer photothermal", "therapy. Additionally, gold nanoparticles can be conjugated with a variety of therapeutic agents and targeting ligands, functioning effectively as drug carriers. The intravital kinetics of nano-drug delivery systems (nano-DDS) can vary signi\ufb01cantly; their behavior in biological environments is in\ufb02uenced not only by their size but also by their chemical composition and morphology. However, size remains the most critical factor determining the physiological behavior of nano-DDS [13]. 338 Pankaj Kumar Umar et al. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) continues to pose a signi\ufb01cant global health challenge, often resulting in unfavorable clinical out- comes. With advancements in our understanding of the underlying genes and molecular mechanisms, cell and molecular therapies have emerged as promising new treatment strategies for CVD. Never- theless, early studies have shown disappointing outcomes due to insuf\ufb01cient delivery to the intended sites and inadequate expression of genes or successful engraftment of cells [14]. Advancements in micro/nano particles (MNPs) have enabled the development of sophisticated drug delivery systems (DDSs) that are capable of targeted delivery and controlled release [15]. The fascinating char- acteristics of new materials that respond to changes in their sur- rounding environment have motivated researchers to create more intelligent drug delivery systems (DDSs) capable of reacting to speci\ufb01c and predictable stimuli at the target site. Currently, stimuli such as magnetic \ufb01elds (MF) and ultrasound (US) can be employed to initiate the release of drugs [16]. Moreover, the sophisticated design of smart drug delivery systems (DDSs) may enable these vehicles to respond to multiple combinations of various stimuli, enhancing site speci\ufb01city and improving controll", "mployed to initiate the release of drugs [16]. Moreover, the sophisticated design of smart drug delivery systems (DDSs) may enable these vehicles to respond to multiple combinations of various stimuli, enhancing site speci\ufb01city and improving controlled delivery [17]. 2 Delivery of Small Molecules Traditionally, small molecules have been the primary form of treat- ment for cardiovascular diseases. Widely used drugs in this category include atorvastatin, metoprolol, valsartan, and ezetimibe, which are typically available as oral medications and are used for long-term management of cardiovascular conditions. Given the immense mar- ket value in cardiovascular treatment, which amounts to billions of dollars, there is substantial interest in developing new medications as well as improving delivery systems for these existing drugs. The \ufb01eld of small molecule drug delivery has become a signi\ufb01- cant focus of research, and several innovative technologies have emerged over the last few decades. One of the primary challenges in drug development is the failure of drug candidates in clinical trials, which often occurs due to poor pharmacokinetic properties. This issue has prompted a shift in the drug discovery process, leading to the earlier integration of pharmacokinetic factors such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination, and", "toxicology (ADME/Tox). By incorporating these considerations earlier in the drug development pipeline, researchers can ensure that drug-like properties are built into new compounds from the outset. Drug Delivery to the Cardiovascular System: Application and Future Prospects 339 In some cases, standard medicinal chemistry approaches are not enough to overcome the challenges associated with drug delivery, especially when these compounds are tested in preclinical models or administered to humans. In such instances, advanced formulation technologies have been employed to enhance the drug\u2019s ability to reach its target site effectively. One of the main challenges in the delivery of small molecule drugs is solubility, which can be improved through the use of nanoformulation techniques. Nano- medicine offers distinct advantages in drug delivery by not only enhancing the drug\u2019s distribution to its target but also providing protection against toxicity in non-target organs. For example, a recent study led by Liu and colleagues demonstrated how the use of a hyaluronic acid polymer nanoparticle combined with Intralipid 20% could signi\ufb01cantly reduce the toxicity of platinum-based can- cer drugs in organs, such as the liver, spleen, and kidney. Intralipid is currently being tested in human clinical trials to evaluate its effectiveness in cardiac reperfusion therapy. In recent years, various types of nanomedicine have been devel- oped to address different therapeutic needs. The choice of a speci\ufb01c formulation depends on a range of factors, including the chemical properties of the drug, such as solubility and molecular weight, as well as the intended therapeutic goal. For example, if the objective is to treat peripheral organ systems, the primary formulation target may be to protect the", "including the chemical properties of the drug, such as solubility and molecular weight, as well as the intended therapeutic goal. For example, if the objective is to treat peripheral organ systems, the primary formulation target may be to protect the drug from metabolism. In other cases, nanoformulation may be used to improve the distribution of the drug to speci\ufb01c target organs, such as the brain. The blood-brain barrier (BBB), which is highly selective, only allows certain com- pounds to pass through via transcellular or transporter-mediated uptake. A recent study highlighted a novel approach to overcoming this barrier by activating the A2A adenosine receptor (A2A AR), which was shown to open the BBB, potentially allowing drugs like chemotherapeutic agents\u2014normally excluded from the brain\u2014to reach the central nervous system (CNS). Various nanoformulations have been developed for small organic molecules, including liposomes, nanoparticles, nanocap- sules, nanotubes, polymeric conjugates, and micelles. While these formulations have been most extensively used in treating cancer and central nervous system diseases, other therapeutic areas such as orthopedics and cardiovascular diseases are now emerging as promising \ufb01elds for novel drug delivery strategies. The general approach for nanoformulating small molecules involves encapsulat- ing the drug within a polymer carrier system. In this method, the lipophilic properties of the drug interact with the lipophilic regions of the polymer, causing the polymer to self-assemble and form a", "m a", "protective barrier between the drug and its aqueous environment. Other nanoformulation methods include conjugating the drug to the polymer or forming a complex with systems such as glutathione or folate. These innovative approaches provide signi\ufb01cant potential for improving the delivery, ef\ufb01cacy, and safety of small molecule therapies across various disease conditions. 340 Pankaj Kumar Umar et al. 3 Drawbacks of Conventional Drug Delivery System Despite signi\ufb01cant advancements in conventional drug delivery systems (DDSs), there are still notable limitations, especially in the context of cardiovascular applications. One of the primary challenges lies in the extremely low ef\ufb01ciency of gene transfection and cell engraftment at the target site. This inef\ufb01cient delivery of drugs often results in insuf\ufb01cient drug concentrations at the desired location, which in turn leads to suboptimal therapeutic outcomes. Furthermore, conventional DDSs are prone to off-target effects, where the drugs may unintentionally affect surrounding tissues, potentially causing adverse side effects. Another major limitation of traditional drug delivery methods is the dif\ufb01culty in tracking drug movement and behavior in real- time within the body. Conventional systems often lack the capabil- ity to monitor how well drugs are retained at the target site and how they are distributed throughout the body. Without this real-time tracking, it is challenging to ensure the effectiveness of the treat- ment or make necessary adjustments during therapy. To address these drawbacks, there has been growing interest in utilizing external stimuli, such as magnetic \ufb01elds (MF) and ultra- sound (US), as part of novel drug delivery strategies. These meth- ods offer a non-invasive approach to drug delivery and possess intri", "e drawbacks, there has been growing interest in utilizing external stimuli, such as magnetic \ufb01elds (MF) and ultra- sound (US), as part of novel drug delivery strategies. These meth- ods offer a non-invasive approach to drug delivery and possess intrinsic biomedical effects that make them particularly attractive. The application of external stimuli allows for more precise control over drug release and distribution, potentially improving therapeu- tic outcomes while minimizing side effects. 4 Factors Affecting Cardiovascular Drug Targeting System The design and development of vascular-speci\ufb01c drug delivery vehicles require careful consideration of several physical attributes, such as particle size, shape, density, and how they behave in blood \ufb02ow. These characteristics are essential to ensure that the drug carriers can travel effectively through the bloodstream and selec- tively bind to the target receptors on the endothelial lining of vascular plaques and walls. Factors such as particle shape, size, density, and their interaction with blood \ufb02ow dynamics are critical in the development of vascular-targeted drug delivery systems. By", "optimizing these factors, drug carriers can be engineered to improve their precision in targeting diseased areas within the vas- cular system, leading to more effective therapies for vascular-related diseases. Drug Delivery to the Cardiovascular System: Application and Future Prospects 341 4.1 Particle Shape Spherical particles are often preferred due to their favorable hydro- dynamic properties and ease of fabrication. The shape of the drug delivery vehicle signi\ufb01cantly impacts its ability to circulate in the bloodstream, its internalization into target cells, and its ef\ufb01ciency in binding to speci\ufb01c receptors. Spherical particles are typically cleared more quickly by the body, which can reduce their overall effective- ness. However, non-spherical particles, such as those with disk- or rod-like shapes, tend to remain in circulation for a longer time, offering greater resistance to rapid renal clearance. This prolonged circulation enhances their ability to target speci\ufb01c areas within the vascular system. The oblong or elongated shape of these non-spherical particles allows them to experience lower drag forces, improve adhesion to the vascular walls, and provide more binding sites for targeting ligands. As a result, non-spherical particles may be more effective for targeted vascular drug delivery. 4.2 Particle Size The size of the particles is also critical for successful drug delivery. Particles that range from tens of nanometers to submicron sizes are ideal for intravenous delivery through the microcirculatory system. These small particles are less likely to trigger an immune response, allowing them to circulate longer without being cleared. While nanosized particles are advantageous in this regard, microparticles, which are larger (ranging between 2 to 5 micrometers), ", "small particles are less likely to trigger an immune response, allowing them to circulate longer without being cleared. While nanosized particles are advantageous in this regard, microparticles, which are larger (ranging between 2 to 5 micrometers), tend to exhibit stronger adhesion to their target, particularly in larger vessels such as arteries, which are commonly affected by conditions like atherosclerosis or peripheral artery disease. Microparticles, regardless of their shape, demonstrate a higher binding af\ufb01nity compared to nanosized particles. However, particles should not exceed 5 micrometers in size, as larger particles are subjected to greater disruptive forces and increased wear and tear, resulting in diminished adhesion ef\ufb01ciency to the targeted site. 4.3 Particle Density The density of the particles plays an important role in how well they can move toward and adhere to vascular walls. Different materials used for vascular targeting have various densities based on their composition. For example, FDA-approved biodegradable polymers typically have a neutral buoyancy or a density slightly higher than that of blood. In contrast, inorganic particles such as silica or gold have much higher densities than blood, which can enhance their performance in targeted delivery. Silica particles, for instance, exhibit better adhesion to vascular walls than polystyrene particles of the same size. This is largely due to the fact that silica is almost twice as dense as blood, whereas polystyrene is neutrally buoyant.", "The higher density of silica helps the particles marginate, or move toward the vascular wall, more effectively, which increases their ability to bind to the target site. 342 Pankaj Kumar Umar et al. 4.4 Flow Characteristics Blood \ufb02ow dynamics, or hemodynamics, are critical in determining how well the drug delivery particles adhere to the endothelium and interact with target receptors. Various factors, including shear forces, \ufb02ow patterns, the presence of red blood cells, and the height of the blood vessel channels, in\ufb02uence these interactions. Interest- ingly, the pulsatile nature of blood \ufb02ow, which involves periodic \ufb02uctuations in velocity and pressure, and \ufb02ow recirculation gener- ally do not signi\ufb01cantly affect the adhesion of nanoparticles. This is because nanoparticles are small enough that they are less in\ufb02uenced by the disruptive forces generated by blood \ufb02ow. On the other hand, microparticles (0.5\u20135 micrometers in size) are more suscep- tible to these \ufb02ow dynamics. Their adhesion ef\ufb01ciency increases when they have longer residence times in the bloodstream and experience lower slip velocities, especially in pulsatile \ufb02ows. Regard- less of their shape, microparticles have been shown to adhere more effectively in areas where blood \ufb02ow is disturbed by shear forces. 5 Various Targeted Drug Delivery Systems 5.1 Application of Exosomes and EVs (Extracellular Vesicles) There are various drug delivery techniques to the cardiovascular system as described above (Fig. 1). Primarily, vesicles that are introduced from the exterior of the cell to aid in the transport of active pharmaceutical ingredients can be categorized into three main types: apoptotic bodies, which range in size from Fig. 1 Different techniques of drug delivery to cardiovascular system", "r of the cell to aid in the transport of active pharmaceutical ingredients can be categorized into three main types: apoptotic bodies, which range in size from Fig. 1 Different techniques of drug delivery to cardiovascular system", "400 to 2500 nm in radius; ectosomes or microvesicles, with a radius of 50\u2013500 nm; and exosomes, which are the smallest at 15\u201350 nm in radius. These extracellular vesicles (EVs) play signi\ufb01cant patho- physiological roles in various cardiovascular diseases, in\ufb02uencing key processes such as angiogenesis, tissue swelling, and the repair of damaged cardiac tissues (Fig. 2). Their involvement is associated with a variety of molecules, including nucleic acids and cytokines, which migrate to different cell types, such as immune cells and \ufb01broblasts. This highlights the complex interactions and contribu- tions of EVs in the context of cardiovascular health and disease [18]. The proteins found on the surface of extracellular vesicles are also critical for effective cardiovascular drug delivery. These surface proteins can facilitate interactions between the vesicles and target cells, enhancing the speci\ufb01city and ef\ufb01ciency of the delivery process. By mediating recognition and binding to speci\ufb01c receptors on target cells, these proteins help ensure that the therapeutic agents carried by the vesicles are delivered accurately to the intended sites of action. This feature not only improves the therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy of the drugs but also minimizes potential side effects, making the proteins on extracellular vesicles an essential component in the development of advanced drug delivery strategies for cardiovascular applications [19]. Drug Delivery to the Cardiovascular System: Application and Future Prospects 343 Fig. 2 Application of extracellular vesicles in cardiovascular diseases For example, proteins such as CD14, Serpin F2, and G1, along with cystatin C and various microRNAs, have been identi\ufb01ed as having functional roles in cardiovascular drug delivery.

They can act as \u201cprocoagulant\u201d proteins or serve as biomarkers for the detection and treatment of conditions like stroke and heart dysfunction. The signi\ufb01cant potential of proteins, lipids, and microRNAs in exo- somes and extracellular vesicles (EVs) to enhance targeted drug delivery to the heart and cardiovascular system has been", "emphasized. Notably, microRNAs like miR-146a and miR-21 have been linked to the progression of various stages of cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial infarction, plaque buildup in arteries, and heart failure [20]. 344 Pankaj Kumar Umar et al. The inherent properties and activities of extracellular vesicles (EVs) and exosomes have been the focus of extensive research aimed at uncovering their potential and functions as biotherapeutic agents, especially in the context of cardiovascular diseases. For example, exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells have demonstrated the ability to promote blood vessel regeneration. They play a crucial role in mitigating the damaging effects of free radicals by reducing oxidative stress in the body. This capability not only supports the healing processes within the cardiovascular sys- tem but also highlights the therapeutic promise of using exosomes in treating various cardiovascular conditions. The exploration of these vesicles continues to reveal their multifaceted roles in enhanc- ing vascular health and providing protective effects against oxida- tive damage, paving the way for innovative treatment strategies [21]. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from cardiac progenitor cells have been demonstrated to enhance blood vessel develop- ment, with their effects mediated by speci\ufb01c metalloproteinase components. Additionally, EVs can be produced by endothelial cells and blood platelets, offering a wide range of bene\ufb01cial effects for cardiovascular therapy. These effects include promoting angio- genesis, reducing plaque formation, and aiding in the restoration of blood \ufb02ow or revascularization processes [22]. During a heart attack, or myocardial infarction, the tiny size of extracellular vesicles (EVs) has been demonstrated to", "omoting angio- genesis, reducing plaque formation, and aiding in the restoration of blood \ufb02ow or revascularization processes [22]. During a heart attack, or myocardial infarction, the tiny size of extracellular vesicles (EVs) has been demonstrated to be advantageous for targeted drug delivery to the swollen myocardium. This effectiveness is largely attributed to the \u201cenhanced permeability and retention\u201d (EPR) effect, which allows these vesicles to penetrate tissues more easily and remain in the targeted area for longer periods. For optimal success in targeted delivery, it is crucial that the biotherapeutic agents incorporated into the EVs do not undergo any changes to their surface characteristics. Maintaining the integrity of the surface ensures that the vesicles can effectively bind to the target cells and deliver their therapeutic payload, enhancing the overall ef\ufb01cacy of the treatment during such critical cardiovascular events [23]. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) offer signi\ufb01cant bene\ufb01ts in the targeted delivery of therapeutic agents such as microRNAs (miR- NAs) that possess neuroprotective properties, particularly in the context of cardiovascular conditions like stroke. One of the key challenges in treating such ailments is the presence of the blood- brain barrier, which typically restricts the entry of many therapeutic compounds into the brain. However, EVs have the unique ability to cross this barrier, allowing them to deliver miRNAs directly to the affected neural tissues. This targeted delivery not only enhances the", "effectiveness of the treatment but also minimizes potential side effects by ensuring that the therapeutic agents reach the speci\ufb01c areas where they are needed most. By utilizing EVs as carriers, researchers can leverage their natural properties to improve thera- peutic outcomes in stroke patients, thereby opening new avenues for effective treatment strategies [24]. While enhanced uptake of drug-carrying vesicles by the liver can diminish the effectiveness of this therapeutic approach, genetically modi\ufb01ed extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been demonstrated to help mitigate this issue [25]. The drawbacks associated with the intramyocardial delivery method can be addressed by modifying the surface characteristics of exosomes. These alterations have resulted in improved blood vessel regenera- tion, better retention of exosomes in the heart, and the promotion of cardiomyocyte propagation. Additionally, the modi\ufb01ed exo- somes have been shown to decrease their uptake in the liver, effec- tively overcoming one of the main challenges in cardiovascular drug delivery [26]. Drug Delivery to the Cardiovascular System: Application and Future Prospects 345 5.2 Ultrasound- Mediated Drug Delivery The primary goal of this method of drug delivery across the cell membrane is to improve the ability of substances to penetrate cells or enhance their permeability. In the context of ultrasound- mediated cardiovascular therapy, there are three key aspects to consider: 1. Cavitation: This phenomenon involves the oscillation of microbubbles, which can be either inertial or stable. The result- ing pulsing action generated by these oscillations helps to propel drugs into blood clots, facilitating their targeted deliv- ery and improving therapeutic outcomes. 2. Radiation Force from Ultrasound: This f", "be either inertial or stable. The result- ing pulsing action generated by these oscillations helps to propel drugs into blood clots, facilitating their targeted deliv- ery and improving therapeutic outcomes. 2. Radiation Force from Ultrasound: This force plays a vital role, particularly in cardiovascular treatments, as it helps to direct microbubbles toward the intended cardiac or cardiovascular tissues. By generating a sustained force, the ultrasound effec- tively guides the microbubbles to the targeted site, enhancing the delivery of therapeutic agents [27]. 3. Sonothrombolysis: This represents the most signi\ufb01cant applica- tion of ultrasound combined with microbubble therapy. It involves the non-invasive disintegration of blood clots and the restoration of blood \ufb02ow through the use of high- frequency ultrasound. This technique can be employed either alone or in conjunction with the cavitation effect of microbub- bles, offering a powerful approach to treating conditions like thrombosis [28]. Together, these aspects underscore the potential of ultrasound- mediated therapy to enhance drug delivery and improve outcomes in cardiovascular treatments. The application of sonothrombolysis combined with targeted microbubbles serves two primary", "purposes: \ufb01rst, to identify and localize the blood clot, and second, to facilitate its breakdown through ultrasonic-induced cavitation [29]. The effectiveness of the \u201cultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction\u201d (UTMD) technique has been documented for deliv- ering genes and genetic drugs to cardiac tissues and related organs. For instance, in a mouse model of heart attack, the use of Per\ufb02utren for transferring \u201cstem cell factor,\u201d \u201cvascular endothelial growth factor,\u201d and \u201cgreen \ufb02uorescent protein\u201d via UTMD resulted in improved restoration of cardiac tissues and enhanced migration of stem cells to the heart. 346 Pankaj Kumar Umar et al. The UTMD procedure has shown the capability to increase the engraftment of mesenchymal, cardiac, and endothelial progenitor cells in animal models with reduced sizes. One notable advantage of microbubbles is their ability to carry much higher concentrations of gases compared to standard liquids, a feature that is especially crucial during heart attacks, when cardiac muscles urgently require elevated levels of oxygen [30]. When it comes to utilizing ultrasound for targeted drug deliv- ery in cardiovascular therapy, sonothrombolysis remains a signi\ufb01- cant focus, particularly in the treatment of strokes and myocardial infarctions. In the case of strokes, standalone ultrasound interventions\u2014without the use of microbubbles\u2014combined with tissue plasminogen activator have demonstrated positive results. For heart attacks, the healing effects are primarily linked to the ability to restore blood \ufb02ow in both the epicardium and the myo- cardial microvascular bed [31]. However, complications following sonothrombolysis have been noted. In advancing drug delivery for cardiovascular therapy, the use of molecular contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has b", " both the epicardium and the myo- cardial microvascular bed [31]. However, complications following sonothrombolysis have been noted. In advancing drug delivery for cardiovascular therapy, the use of molecular contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has been documented for applications within both the heart and the vascular system. Speci\ufb01cally, in the context of the heart, efforts focus on identifying acute in\ufb02ammatory responses after heart attacks. This is achieved by directing microbubbles toward white blood cells or by modifying the surfaces of microbubbles with ligands that speci\ufb01cally recognize leukocytes [32]. In the vascular system, research efforts are focused on the precise monitoring of atherosclerosis progression and endothelial repair by targeting microbubbles to speci\ufb01c markers such as vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1), P-selectin, and junction adhesion molecule (JAM-A), among others. One of the primary advantages of the therapeutic molecular contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) pro- cedure is its use of high mechanical index ultrasound, which facil- itates the physical disintegration of thrombi and enhances thrombolysis. This approach is particularly bene\ufb01cial as it helps to mitigate the hemorrhagic complications that are commonly asso- ciated with existing revascularization techniques. By effectively combining targeted delivery with controlled ultrasound applica- tion, CEUS holds promise for improving the management and", "treatment of vascular conditions while reducing the risks of adverse effects typically seen in traditional methods [33]. Drug Delivery to the Cardiovascular System: Application and Future Prospects 347 5.3 Magnetic- Responsive Drug Delivery Systems Magnetic nanoparticles (MagNPs) are already in use in clinical settings. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide both structural and functional insights for diagnosing and validating cardiovascular disease (CVD) through the use of contrast agents made from superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs). MagNPs have distinct characteristics that make them suitable for various biomedical applications. These complexes are biocompati- ble and can effectively guide therapeutic agents to speci\ufb01c target sites, enhancing treatment ef\ufb01cacy while allowing for real-time tracking via MRI. The use of magnetic nanoparticles represents an innovative strategy for developing targeted drug delivery systems (DDS), which offer numerous advantageous features [34]. First and foremost, the magnetic nanoparticle (MagNP) com- plexes that have received clinical approval are designed to be bio- compatible. Given that bare iron oxide can be cytotoxic, researchers have developed a core-shell model for MagNPs, utilizing various materials for the shell, including silicon oxide, liposomes, polyeth- ylene glycol, polyethyleneimine, and derivatives of dextran\u2014all known for their favorable biocompatibility [35]. The choice of shell material is crucial, as it signi\ufb01cantly in\ufb02uences the \ufb01nal size and geometry of the MagNPs, which in turn affects their distribu- tion throughout the body and their kinetics of cellular uptake. Additionally, it is possible to directly attach negatively charged nucleic acids to the surfaces of MagNPs coated with cationic po", "ry of the MagNPs, which in turn affects their distribu- tion throughout the body and their kinetics of cellular uptake. Additionally, it is possible to directly attach negatively charged nucleic acids to the surfaces of MagNPs coated with cationic poly- mers through electrostatic interactions. This capability enhances the versatility of MagNPs in biomedical applications, particularly in targeted drug delivery and gene therapy [36]. Second, the magnetic properties of magnetic nanoparticles (MagNPs) enable targeted drug delivery when an external mag- netic \ufb01eld (MF) is applied. For effective site-speci\ufb01c delivery, it is essential for the magnetic \ufb01eld to generate a strong enough attrac- tive force to counteract the hydrodynamic drag that occurs in \ufb02owing \ufb02uids. While permanent magnets can be used for this purpose, they are limited by their effective range and depth of penetration. To address this limitation, researchers have developed electromagnets and magnetizable stents that can maintain a stron- ger and more consistent magnetic force over greater distances. These innovations enhance the ability to capture and direct MagNPs to speci\ufb01c sites within the body, thereby improving the ef\ufb01cacy of targeted drug delivery systems. By employing these advanced magnetic technologies, the potential for localized treat- ment and better therapeutic outcomes in various medical applica- tions can be signi\ufb01cantly enhanced [37]. Third, the targeted accumulation of drugs at the site of interest facilitates therapeutic treatment at lower doses. This technique,", "This technique,", "known as magnetofection, involves combining cells or nucleic acid vectors with magnetic nanoparticles (MagNPs) to accelerate trans- fection rates by magnetically concentrating the therapeutic agents at the desired location. Numerous studies have also shown that the application of an external magnetic \ufb01eld can enhance the penetra- tion of magnetic cells and vectors into tissues, further improving the ef\ufb01cacy of the treatment. This approach not only increases the localized concentration of therapeutic agents but also reduces the potential for systemic side effects, making it a promising strategy for effective drug delivery [38]. 348 Pankaj Kumar Umar et al. Fourth, the real-time tracking of drugs can be detected and visualized noninvasively through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in live subjects [39]. 5.4 Nanomedicines in Cardiovascular Therapy Nanomedicines encompass nanosized particles or specially formu- lated drugs with high surface energy, and they are increasingly employed in cardiovascular (CV) treatments due to their unique properties, such as heightened reactivity, an enhanced ratio of surface area to volume, and improved roughness and wettability [40]. These nanomedicines are utilized in two primary ways for addressing cardiovascular conditions. The \ufb01rst approach involves using nanomedicines as standalone agents to directly activate spe- ci\ufb01c enzymes that can alter cardiovascular metabolic states. This method often employs nanoparticles made from materials like metals, metal oxides, carbon, polymers, and nanocomposites. The second approach focuses on using nanomedicines as carriers to enable regulated and targeted delivery of traditional cardiovascular drugs. In this case, formulations such as polymeric liposomes, micelles, and dendrimers are commonly used. On", "ites. The second approach focuses on using nanomedicines as carriers to enable regulated and targeted delivery of traditional cardiovascular drugs. In this case, formulations such as polymeric liposomes, micelles, and dendrimers are commonly used. Ongoing research is also exploring the integration of nanocarriers into drug-eluting stents and cardiovascular implants, aiming to enhance the effective- ness of nanomedicine in treating cardiovascular diseases (Fig. 3). By improving the delivery and action of therapeutic agents, nanome- dicine holds signi\ufb01cant promise for advancing cardiovascular care [41]. 5.5 PLGA-Based Nanoparticles Polymers have been utilized and advanced for application in nano- formulations, which primarily consist of nanoparticles typically measuring less than 300 nanometers in diameter. One notable example is poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), a polymer derived from the combination of polylactic acid (PLA), and polyglycolic acid (PGA). PLGA is recognized as an FDA-approved biomaterial [13]. PLGA nanoparticles loaded with pitavastatin can effectively prevent the rupture of atherosclerotic plaques by modulating the recruitment of monocytes to these vascular lesions. Additionally, PLGA nanoparticles have been utilized for delivering the antidia- betic drug pioglitazone, which acts as an agonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3). Research has", "demonstrated that nanoparticles encapsulating the thiazolidine- dione (TZD) pioglitazone can inhibit macrophage activation in hyperlipidemic mice, thereby helping to prevent the formation of atherosclerotic plaques in these animals [42]. Drug Delivery to the Cardiovascular System: Application and Future Prospects 349 Fig. 3 Application of nanomedicine in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases PLGA nanoparticles encapsulating the statin pitavastatin have demonstrated the ability to deliver the drug to the vascular endo- thelium, promoting effective therapeutic neovascularization. Fur- ther investigations into the use of these pitavastatin-loaded PLGA nanoparticles focused on their potential to deliver compounds to the heart following a myocardial infarction, aiming to prevent ischemic tissue damage in patients. These nanoparticles successfully mitigated ischemic-reperfusion (I/R) injury in the heart by activat- ing the AKT/PI3K kinase signaling pathway. Additionally, they were found to reduce in\ufb02ammation, which is responsible for the secondary tissue damage often observed after a myocardial infarc- tion [43]. These pitavastatin nanoparticles have the potential to be bene\ufb01cial in treating organ ischemia across various disease states, serving as an exemplary case of cardiovascular drug delivery through nanoformulations [44]. Various metal nanoparticles-based treatments are also found to be bene\ufb01cial against cardiovascular ailments, as depicted in Table 1. 5.6 Liposomal Delivery Systems Liposomes are vesicle-based systems frequently utilized in drug delivery. They are formed when lipids and surfactants are suspended in an aqueous environment, leading to the self-assembly of spheri- cal liposomes. The lipophilic core of these liposomes naturally accommodates compounds, suc", "uently utilized in drug delivery. They are formed when lipids and surfactants are suspended in an aqueous environment, leading to the self-assembly of spheri- cal liposomes. The lipophilic core of these liposomes naturally accommodates compounds, such as drugs, that have a similar lipo- philic nature. One of the primary reasons for formulating small", "molecules into liposomes has been to enhance their oral bioavail- ability. In a study by Patel et al. [45], the delivery of antihyperten- sive agents targeting the angiotensin II receptor\u2014speci\ufb01cally telmisartan and irbesartan\u2014was improved. Both drugs are poorly soluble in water, but by using castor oil alongside surfactants like Tween 20 and Carbitol as co-solvents, a self-emulsifying drug delivery system (SEDDS) was created, which increased the oral absorption of these compounds by more than 7.5 times [46]. 350 Pankaj Kumar Umar et al.

However, several challenges are asso- ciated with using these drugs, including the chemical properties of the compounds, which may hinder adequate distribution, as well as the pathological conditions of the affected tissues. Currently, there is a signi\ufb01cant shift in the therapeutic landscape for cardiovascular diseases, expanding the range of treatments to include biological agents such as antibodies, proteins, peptides, siRNA, and DNA. 5.8 RNA-Based Delivery Silencing RNA (siRNA) has been effectively delivered to animals through nanoformulations, offering the potential for precision medici", "eatments to include biological agents such as antibodies, proteins, peptides, siRNA, and DNA. 5.8 RNA-Based Delivery Silencing RNA (siRNA) has been effectively delivered to animals through nanoformulations, offering the potential for precision medicine. In a study by Leuschner et al. [47], siRNA was encapsulated in liposomes composed of cholesterol, C12\u2013200 lipid, distearoylphosphatidylcholine, and PEG-DMG, resulting in spontaneously formed micellar liposomes. These siRNA liposomes successfully knocked down the expression of CCR2 in monocytes of atherosclerosis-prone animals [48]. Additionally, exosomes have emerged as a promising means for delivering therapeutic siRNA. They play a signi\ufb01cant role in cellular communication, allowing cells to transfer various cytosolic components, including RNA and microRNA, to one another. Exosomes derived from human- induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been shown to deliver siRNA to pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells, effectively reducing in\ufb02ammation [47].", "Drug Delivery to the Cardiovascular System: Application and Future Prospects 351 5.9 Therapeutic Proteins and Peptides Therapeutic peptides have emerged as signi\ufb01cant strategies for treating cardiovascular diseases. However, their delivery poses chal- lenges due to susceptibility to enzyme degradation in the blood- stream, reduced permeability through vascular endothelial cells, and limited tissue distribution [49]. One traditional method to enhance their circulation time in the blood is to attach polyethylene glycol (PEG) linkers to the peptides [50]. Another strategy involves creating a cyclic version of the linear peptide, which is less vulnera- ble to metabolic degradation in circulation. For instance, the pep- tide HYD1 was cyclized to produce MTI-101, which demonstrated improved ef\ufb01cacy in animal models. Additionally, peptides can serve as targeting agents to direct nanoparticles to speci\ufb01c tissues or organs [51]. 6 Future Perspectives and Challenges Given the increasing number of patients affected by cardiovascular disease (CVD), there is an urgent need for novel drug delivery systems and targeted strategies for therapeutic agents. Innovative experimental methods have been reported, such as the targeted delivery of small molecule drugs, biologics, RNA-based therapeu- tics, and stem cells, all of which have shown promising results in preclinical studies. However, these scienti\ufb01c advancements and technological innovations have yet to be fully integrated into clini- cal practice. It is becoming increasingly evident that additional efforts, commitment, and investment are required to accelerate the testing, translation, and commercialization of these new and effective cardiovascular therapies. Ongoing initiatives to tackle the challenges in this \ufb01eld, particularly tho", "additional efforts, commitment, and investment are required to accelerate the testing, translation, and commercialization of these new and effective cardiovascular therapies. Ongoing initiatives to tackle the challenges in this \ufb01eld, particularly those highlighted by the Spe- cialty Section on Cardiovascular Drug Delivery, are essential for translating new therapeutics and reducing the global impact of cardiovascular diseases [52]. Despite signi\ufb01cant advancements in external stimulus- responsive drug delivery systems (DDSs), a critical challenge remains: the ef\ufb01ciency of gene transfection and cell engraftment is often inadequate, failing to produce meaningful biomedical effects for clinical therapy in cardiovascular disease (CVD). The primary objective of DDSs should be to create clinically viable formulations for patients. Although sonothrombolysis has shown promise in early clinical trials, many investigations into gene or cell therapy remain in the preclinical phase due to structural and physiological differences, as well as maximum dose limitations between animal models and humans. These factors present substantial obstacles for clinical application. To enhance clinical viability, gene or cell ther- apy should be used alongside existing pharmacological or interven- tional treatments as complementary therapies. Furthermore, past studies have often overlooked secondary endpoints, such as", "microvascular perfusion, collateral blood \ufb02ow, and metabolic rates, which are critically in\ufb02uenced by the integrity of endothelial walls and require validated measurements of novel parameters. 352 Pankaj Kumar Umar et al. Additionally, while many previous studies have conducted thor- ough safety assessments of drug delivery systems (DDSs), there is still a limited understanding of how nanostructures interact with different biological systems in vivo, as well as the mechanisms underlying their potential toxicity. Issues related to nanotoxicity, such as cytotoxicity and carcinogenicity, are believed to arise from the physicochemical properties of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), including their size, shape, composition, and surface coatings [53]. Recently, researchers introduced the concept of the protein corona phenomenon, which describes how magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) become coated with various serum proteins through dif- ferent adsorption mechanisms. This structure is believed to signi\ufb01- cantly impact the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of the nanoparticles, presenting a promising area for the design of new drug delivery systems (DDSs) [54]. In the future, emerging drug candidates like circRNAs and exosomes are expected to bene\ufb01t from the advancement of innovative drug delivery systems (DDSs), enabling the translation of drugs with short half-lives and low water solubility into preclinical applications [55]. Further research is essential to enhance the design of delivery vehicles and the parameters for external stimuli to ensure effective drug delivery while minimizing adverse effects. Given that dual stimulus-responsive delivery systems have demonstrated signi\ufb01cant utility, fostering collaboration among various drug delivery strate- gies will be crucial for dev", "li to ensure effective drug delivery while minimizing adverse effects. Given that dual stimulus-responsive delivery systems have demonstrated signi\ufb01cant utility, fostering collaboration among various drug delivery strate- gies will be crucial for developing more innovative approaches. Additionally, it is important to showcase the cost-effectiveness and practicality of these techniques to achieve broader acceptance among cardiologists in clinical settings. Overall, external stimulus- responsive drug delivery systems hold great promise for advancing the treatment of cardiovascular diseases in the near future. Continued efforts are needed to create optimal delivery systems that facilitate greater drug accumulation and uptake at target sites, while also effectively reducing toxicity. 7 Conclusion Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) pose a signi\ufb01cant threat to human health and well-being. Despite the availability of various drugs on the market that operate through different mechanisms, conven- tional formulations for treating CVDs often fall short of expecta- tions. This is primarily due to challenges such as poor water solubility, low biological ef\ufb01cacy, lack of targeting, and the emer- gence of drug resistance. Effective therapeutic delivery to the car- diovascular system is crucial for successfully managing a range of", "conditions, including atherosclerosis, ischemic-reperfusion injury, and other microvascular disorders like hypertension. To address these challenges, several innovative technologies have been devel- oped for both targeted and sustained delivery of new therapeutic agents, encompassing both chemical compounds and biological therapies. The \ufb01eld of speci\ufb01cally targeted drug delivery to the cardiovascular system holds signi\ufb01cant promise, offering several advantages that could enhance treatment ef\ufb01cacy. In this review, we explore various options for creating effective delivery systems, including nanoparticles, peptides, and small interfering RNA (siRNA), that can be directed toward the cardiovascular system. The development of effective formulations utilizing nanotechnol- ogy has the potential to surmount physiological barriers and signif- icantly improve therapeutic outcomes for patients. However, this area is still in its early stages compared to more established \ufb01elds such as cancer or brain drug delivery. These novel delivery methods open up a multitude of opportunities for achieving the necessary tissue speci\ufb01city and minimizing systemic exposure, paving the way for the use of new pharmacological agents that could lead to better patient outcomes in the future.

Deka, Jadav Sarma, and Arjun Ka\ufb02e Abstract The quality of life for patients and those caregivers can be greatly reduced by muscle disorders that results in a loss of function and mobility. For abnormalities and disorders of the muscles, there are limited therapy choices. One of the barriers to the creation of novel treatment approaches is the \u201cblood-muscle barrier,\u201d which refers to the slow rate at which drugs diffuse from blood vessels to muscle. Consequently, the ef\ufb01cient therapy of muscle disorders depends on drug delivery methods and techniques that speci\ufb01cally target muscles. Musculo-targeted drugs and their delivery strategies to the musculoskeletal system are compre- hensively covered in this chapter. Basic information regarding the morphology and molecular biology of muscle is also described to improve our comprehension of the existing musculoskeletal targeted drug delivery systems. Key words Blood-muscle barrier, Musculoskeletal system, Musculo-targeted drugs, Delivery strate- gies, Drug delivery systems, Therapy 1 Introduction Skeletal muscle is one of the most prevalent tissues in the human body. It makes up about 40\u201350% of the body\u2019s total mass and is required to produce movement-inducing forces [21]. The body depends on the musculoskeletal system for support, stability, and mobility, and musculoskeletal disorders can have a major negative impact on public health and the global economy [12, 39, 44]. The movement or musculoskeletal functions of the human body can be impacted by musculoskeletal disorders, which typically entail a variety of aberrant physiologies in the muscles, joints, and bones (e.g., Sarcopenia, Osteoporosis, trauma) [17, 18, 22,", "he movement or musculoskeletal functions of the human body can be impacted by musculoskeletal disorders, which typically entail a variety of aberrant physiologies in the muscles, joints, and bones (e.g., Sarcopenia, Osteoporosis, trauma) [17, 18, 22, 29, 30, 41]. Owing in part to the aging of the world\u2019s population, the World Health Organization has projected a sharply rising burden of musculoskeletal disorders [5, 10]. Many treatments, including sys- temic medication treatment and surgery, have been developed to Abhishek Pathak and Satya Pal Singh (eds.), Next-Generation Drug Delivery Systems, Methods in Pharmacology and Toxicology, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-4554-3_16, \u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025 357", "prevent and treat musculoskeletal disorders. In addition to systemic drug delivery, local drug delivery has gained a lot of interest in the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders. This is primarily because local drug delivery has the potential to reduce toxicity or unwanted side effects while delivering therapeutic agents to the desired site of action and maintaining an optimal drug level for predetermined amounts of time [15, 24, 28, 34, 40, 44, 48]. 358 Khumtya Debbarma et al. This chapter provides in-depth information, step-by-step instructions for the use of localized therapies and repair for muscu- loskeletal disorders by targeting injured tissues, in order to demon- strate the application of local drug delivery. Additionally, local drug administration can minimize systemic toxicity and unwanted side effects while precisely controlling and maintaining high drug con- centrations at the intended area. 2 Materials 2.1 Equipment The experimental apparatus is described in detail; however, any model with a similar capacity can be used interchangeably. 1. 3D bioprinter (envisionTEC): A 3D PCL (polycaprolactone) scaffold grafted with bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) attached via polydopamine chemistry. 2.

Though the initial procedures are similar, many methods have been devised to deposit the components (Fig. 1a). The three most prominent to these printing methods are extrusion-based, inkjet, and light-based. 3.1.1 Extrusion-Based 3D Bioprinting Extrusion-based bioprinting is the most commonly used three- dimensional bioprinting. (i) This method depends on forcing material out of a printhead\u2014 typically a needle tip by applying either mechanical or pneu- matic pressure, to a reservoir of bioink [26]. (ii) Introduction of micro\ufb02uidic printhead as an alternative of conventional reservoirs of printing has increased the accuracy of extrusion bioprinting. (iii) With micro\ufb02uidic heads, printing with core-shell \ufb02uid \ufb02ows and crosslinking the material are made possible with greater control over the composition of the material (Fig. 1b). (iv) As a result, a material \ufb01ber is created that can be patterned by dragging the machine\u2019s printhead cross the print region. (v) After the completion of print of each layer, the subsequent layer starts printing when the distance between the print sur- face and the extrusion tip is raised. 3.1.2 Inkjet 3D Bioprinting The \ufb01rst developed 3D bioprinting technique, which is based on the similar idea as that of the conventional 2D Inkjet printing [4, 36]. (i) The \ufb01rst step involves combining cells with a hydrogel pre- polymer solution in an ink cartridge that is attached to a printhead. (ii) This printhead deposits the bioink material throughout the printing process. (iii) During the printing, a piezoelectric actuator or a thermal process d", "ls with a hydrogel pre- polymer solution in an ink cartridge that is attached to a printhead. (ii) This printhead deposits the bioink material throughout the printing process. (iii) During the printing, a piezoelectric actuator or a thermal process deforms the printerheads, which are then squeezed to produced droplets of different sizes (Fig. 1c). (iv) Finally, by sporadically applying pressure to the \ufb02uid reservoir, pressure-driven can accomplish the same result. 3.1.3 Light-Based Bioprinting Stereolithographic bioprinting: According to Wang et al. [42, 43], (i) These devices form the desired construction by using laser light to crosslink polymer solutions (Fig. 1d). (ii) The desired pattern is crosslinked to each layer using light, securing each layer to the previous one.", "Drug Delivery to the Musculoskeletal System: Localized Therapies and Repair 361 Fig. 1 (a) Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting.

(ii) And when the laser strikes the energy-absorbing layer, the ink is deposited from the substrate (Fig. 1e). (iii) As a result, the resolution of this approach is restricted by the homogeneity of the bioink on the glass surface, as aggregation may lead to undesirable heterogeneities. 3.2 Multiple Drug Delivery Multilayer \ufb01lms were constructed as per Zhang et al. [47]. 3.2.1 Multilayer Films with Capsule-Integrated Polypeptide/Polyelectrolyte (i) Microcapsules for drug administration were created by impreg- nating polypeptides (PL or PG) into CaCo3 particles by sub- merging them in a solution containing 2 mg/mL of polyelectrolytes for 30 min under 3 Torr Vacuum pressure. (ii) The samples are then centrifuged to discard the supernatant and further dried in a vacuum oven (310 Torr) overnight at 60 \u00b0 C. 3.2.2 Multilayer Shells Using Polypeptides/ Polyelectrolytes (PL or PG) and LbL Assembly The multilayer shells on these pre-impregnated particles were then alternatively constructed using polypeptides and LbL self-assembly to form shelled CaCO3 particles. (i) This process is similar to that of the procedure described for coating on conventional substrates, but in this instance, a centrifugation step of 3000 rpm for 1 min. Was added between the two-coating process to make the coating pro- cesses on microparticles feasible. (ii) In order to maintain the multilayer shell, the shelled CaCO3 particles were next exposed to cross-linking by being incu- bated in a glutaraldehyde (25%) solution for 3 h. (iii) These shelled particles were centrif", "ses on microparticles feasible. (ii) In order to maintain the multilayer shell, the shelled CaCO3 particles were next exposed to cross-linking by being incu- bated in a glutaraldehyde (25%) solution for 3 h.

(iv) Here, the CaCO3 particles that were impregnated with PL and PG, as well as the ensuing capsules were referred to as CaCO3 PL , CaCO3 PG , Capsule PL , and CapsulePG , respectively. 3.2.3 Multilayer Nano\ufb01lms and Microcapsules Utilizing the LbL self-assembly mechanisms of multilayer nano- \ufb01lms and microcapsules, capsule-integrated polypeptide multilayer \ufb01lms for multidrug delivery were constructed (Fig. 2a).", "Drug Delivery to the Musculoskeletal System: Localized Therapies and Repair 363 Fig. 2 (a) Multilayer nano\ufb01lms using LbL assembly; (b) image showing use of iontophoresis of topical delivery into the layers of the skin Procedure (i) Self-assembly of Polypeptide (PL/PG) X multilayer nano\ufb01lms.

The controlled and focused release of the drug at the site of action makes the stimulus-based drug delivery system extremely valuable in the \ufb01elds of nanomedicines and nanotechnology [6]. The stimuli-responsive drug delivery systems can be categor- ized into two types: physical and chemical. 3.3.1 Physical Stimulation-Responsive Drug Delivery Systems Thermoresponsive Temperature-responsive systems are the most research", "technology [6]. The stimuli-responsive drug delivery systems can be categor- ized into two types: physical and chemical. 3.3.1 Physical Stimulation-Responsive Drug Delivery Systems Thermoresponsive Temperature-responsive systems are the most researched among various stimuli-responsive systems, particularly in the \ufb01eld of cancer [27]. In such a system, changes in the tumor environment\u2019s tem- perature control the release of drugs. The drug load is retained by the thermoresponsive carriers at body temperature, which is around 37 \u00b0C. Nevertheless, the drug is delivered at the approximate 40\u201342 \u00b0C local temperature of the tumor area [37].", "Drug Delivery to the Musculoskeletal System: Localized Therapies and Repair 365 A thermoresponsive drug delivery system is considered as one possible addition to hyperthermia therapy. When treating hyper- thermia, the body tissue is subjected to high temperatures through microwave, ultrasonic, or radiofrequency; cancer cells may be killed or rendered more vulnerable to the targeted effects of radiation therapy or chemotherapy. The hyperthermia treatments are harmful not only to cancer cells but also to healthy cells. Parallel to this, both cancer cells and healthy cells are toxically affected by chemotherapy. Therefore, as a combinatorial approach, the combined effects of chemotherapy and hyperthermia are hazardous to both normal and cancerous cells [16]. Thus, it is suggested to develop thermoresponsive drug deliv- ery systems that make use of the temperature of the tumor micro- environment, i.e., mild hyperthermia (~40 \u00b0C), which releases drugs speci\ufb01cally for the tumor while being non-toxic to healthy cells (Fig. 3a). Typically, thermoresponsive systems consist of poly- meric micelles, liposomes, or nanoparticles that release drugs at signi\ufb01cant rates only when they are exposed to temperatures higher than that of normal body cells, such as cancerous tissue [27]. Thermoresponsive Liposomes \u2022 Thermoresponsive liposomes work by concentrating drug within the heated tumor\u2019s vasculature while reducing drug metabolism, absorption, and clearance. Enhancing the drug\u2019s penetration and concentration at the tumor site, the released drug diffuses into the tumor (Fig. 3b). This method does not rely on the tumor\u2019s passive targeting. The thermoresponsive liposomes are given during the mild hyperthermia treatment to allow for the sudden release of the medicine that has been contained", "rug diffuses into the tumor (Fig. 3b). This method does not rely on the tumor\u2019s passive targeting. The thermoresponsive liposomes are given during the mild hyperthermia treatment to allow for the sudden release of the medicine that has been contained inside the tumor [37]. \u2022 Liposomes that possess appropriate gel to liquid phase transition temperatures, like lysolipids or dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine, are typically employed in thermoresponsive liposome development [38]. Examples Doxorubicin-loaded thermoresponsive lysolipid-based liposomes (ThermoDox\u00ae , Doxil\u00ae , Myocet\u00ae ). 3.3.2 Magnetic Field- Responsive Drug Delivery Systems (MRDD) A magnetic-responsive system typically comprises of a core-shell structure with polymer, lipids, mesoporous silica, or squalonyl- gemicitabine in the shell and magnetite (Fe3O4) or maghemite (Fe2O3) in the core.", "366 Khumtya Debbarma et al.

[2]), (b) ultrasound-responsive drug delivery (from Ref. [32]), (c) schematic showing light-responsive drug delivery desired places after it has been delivered into the subject either intravenously or intra-arterially. \u2022 Upon reaching the intended location in vivo, the drug is liberated from the magnetic carrier through either enzymatic activity or modi\ufb01cations in physiological parameters including pH, osmolality, and temperature (Fig. 4a). \u2022 This leads to a reduced medication concentration throughout the body and a greater localization at the site of the tumor [11]. Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, or SPIONs, are among the magnetic-responsive nanomaterials under investigation because of their ease of guidance to the target site and lack of residual magnetism, which is attributable to quantum phenomena at the nanoscale [33]. The following characteristics are appropriate for magnetically responsive drug delivery systems: 1. Nanosized constituent particles to facilitate capillary perfusion. 2. They ought to be suf\ufb01ciently magnetically sensitive. 3. They ought to be able to transport a broad range of potent medicinal substances. 4. They may be designed to serve as targeted or controlled drug delivery systems. 5. They are minimally toxic and antigenic, and they have great biocompatibility and biodegradability.", "368 Khumtya Debbarma et al. 3.3.3 Ultrasound- Responsive Drug Delivery Systems (URDDS) The primary application of low frequency ultrasound (LFUS) was to reduce the size of micro to nanoscale vesicles. These days, targeted and controlled drug release is induced by ultrasound. Protocol \u2022 An ultrasonic wave can be used to stimulate the release of drugs that are responsive to ultrasound waves by producing a variety of physical effects in the body\u2019s tissue. Localized heat, cavitation, simple pressure change, and acoustic \ufb02uid streaming are some of these physical effects (Fig. 4b) [9]. \u2022 The signi\ufb01cant effects of ultrasonography are cavitation. \u2022 This effect occurs when an ultrasonic wave passes through a liquid medium and creates a large number of microbubbles that expand and contract in extremely brief amounts of time. Through a technique called sonoporation, the permeability of a cell membrane can be momentarily altered in sonic cavitation to improve medication uptake [45]. \u2022 In cancer therapy, the easy application of ultrasonic to a thermo- responsive system makes it a crucial component. Acoustic cavi- tation, a method of energy vibration, causes hyperthermia when exposed to ultrasound waves. Anticancer medication buildup at the tumor site is facilitated by the application of these sonic waves as a release mechanism through cavitation [46]. 3.3.4 Light-Responsive Drug Delivery Systems (LRDDS) Light is regarded as one of the most interesting external stimuli for controlled drug release because it has an on/off switching pulsatile nature that allows for remote drug release with extreme temporal and spatial precision [23]. LRDDS are mostly used in photodynamic therapy (PDT), a combination therapy that uses light and photoactivatable photo- sensitizer in the presence of tissu", "le nature that allows for remote drug release with extreme temporal and spatial precision [23]. LRDDS are mostly used in photodynamic therapy (PDT), a combination therapy that uses light and photoactivatable photo- sensitizer in the presence of tissue oxygen. \u2022 In photodynamic therapy After injecting the photosensitizer intravenously, tissue oxygen is transformed into radical oxygen species (ROS) via light- mediated activation. \u2022 PDT is a prime candidate for cancer treatment since these ROS result in cellular necrosis. \u2022 In PDT, UV or visible light can cause photoreactions.

(iv) These loaded particles were then injected intraarticularly into the knees. 3.5 Gene Delivery System Another new approach to treating musculoskeletal disorders is gene delivery, which allows for the localized, regulated expression of therapeutic nucleic acids and or proteins. Vector is a gene therapy primer that allows desired gene (cDNA) to insert into the host cells in a way that make them easier to translocate to the nucleus and produce high levels of transgenic expression. 3.5.1 Ex Vivo/Indirect Gene Transfer [13] (i) The desired vector is taken up and transduced into the target cells. (ii) They are subsequently selected and ampli\ufb01ed. (iii) After that, the genetically modi\ufb01ed cells can be directly trans- ferred to the location of musculoskeletal injury or they can be implanted into a scaffold (Fig. 6b). 3.5.2 In Vivo/Direct Gene Transfer [25] (i) Direct gene transfer is the process of introducing the gene transfer vector directly to the site of musculoskeletal injury.

Cell-based treat- ments in musculoskeletal drug delivery have been particularly driven by stem cell engineering, which has the potential to promote the healing of disorders and injured tissues [31]. Procedure (i) Stem cells are progenitor cells derived mostly from bone mar- row and injected directly into tissues to facilitate tissue repair. (ii) Bone marrow\u2013derived mesenchymal stem cells possess poten- tial for chondrogenesis, osteogenesis and radiogenesis. (iii) These cells support the formation of bone by osteogenesis, adipose tissue by adipogenesis, cartilage by chondrogenesis, muscle by myogenesis, and tendon/ligament formation by tendogenesis/ligamentogenesis after differentiating into mes- enchymal progenitor cells (Fig. 7). 4 Conclusion Drug delivery has attracted growing interest as an ef\ufb01cacious ther- apeutic approach for treating a variety of musculoskeletal disorders, including infection, tumor, cancer, etc. In order to achieve precisely controlled and on-demand drug delivery for musculoskeletal treat- ments, many new concepts have been proposed and studied. These include the development of new drugs (such as genes, small mole- cule therapeutics, stem cells, etc.), innovative tools (such as 3D printing, tissue engineering technique, etc.), and novel delivery strategies (such as multiple delivery, smar", "d.

In conclusion, new systems incorporating cutting-edge thera- peutic methodologies are always emerging, but current musculo- skeletal delivery systems are still in their infancy and required additional in vivo or clinical research. Clinical investigations for the treatment of common and uncommon musculoskeletal disor- ders will continue to be motivated by the study of drug delivery due to the swift advancement of new therapeutic medications and deliv- ery methods, as well as the potential of sophisticated drug delivery systems as discussed here.", "372 Khumtya Debbarma et al.

Jogi Abstract The reproductive system poses distinct physiological challenges for effective drug delivery, necessitating innovative strategies to navigate various biological barriers, including the blood-testis barrier, vaginal mucosa, and cervix. Targeted drug delivery is essential for addressing prevalent conditions that require therapeutic intervention, such as reproductive cancers, infertility, and sexually transmitted infections. Recent advancements in drug delivery systems, particularly those utilizing nanotechnology, have demon- strated signi\ufb01cant potential in enhancing the therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy of various agents. Platforms like nano- particles and liposomes facilitate targeted drug delivery, whereas hydrogels and biodegradable polymers enable localized and controlled release of therapeutics. Innovations in injectable and implantable systems, such as drug-eluting intrauterine devices and subdermal implants, have further optimized sustained drug release mechanisms. Additionally, micro- and nano-needles offer minimally invasive methods for direct administration to reproductive tissues. Route-speci\ufb01c delivery methods, including vaginal, uterine, and penile applications, have been investigated to improve bioavailability and patient compliance.

Accord- ing to the World Health Organization (WHO), reproductive health Abhishek Pathak and Satya Pal Singh (eds.), Next-Generation Drug Delivery Systems, Methods in Pharmacology and Toxicology, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-4554-3_17, \u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025 375", "refers to a state of complete well-being in these aspects, beyond merely the absence of disease or dysfunction in relation to the reproductive system and its processes [1, 2]. The Cairo Interna- tional Conference on Population and Development in 2004 iden- ti\ufb01ed \ufb01ve key components essential for sexual and reproductive health care: (1) enhancing services related to antenatal, perinatal, postpartum, and newborn care; (2) providing comprehensive fam- ily planning services, including treatments for infertility; (3) reduc- ing the incidence of unsafe abortions; (4) fostering overall sexual and reproductive health; and (5) addressing various pathological conditions of the reproductive system, such as cancer, infections, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and gynecological disorders [3]. Various strategies have been embraced by the scienti\ufb01c com- munity to enhance sexual and reproductive health services. This chapter will examine innovative methods created by researchers globally to address the physical and medical challenges associated with sexual and reproductive health. 376 Dhaval J. Kamothi et al. Understanding the physical and pathological challenges related to sexual and reproductive health is crucial. Individuals of all gen- ders can experience a range of health issues, which can be categor- ized into four main groups: \ufb01rst, infectious diseases, including sexually transmitted infections like human immunode\ufb01ciency virus (HIV) [4]; second, various cancers, such as breast, cervical, uterine, and ovarian cancers in women, as well as prostate cancer in men [5, 6]; third, infertility, which may arise from factors related to either gender and often necessitates the use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) for treatment [7]; and \ufb01nally, other conditions such as endometr", "well as prostate cancer in men [5, 6]; third, infertility, which may arise from factors related to either gender and often necessitates the use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) for treatment [7]; and \ufb01nally, other conditions such as endometriosis, \ufb01broids, and polycystic ovary syndrome [8, 9]. 2 Importance of Targeted Drug Delivery to the Reproductive System Targeted drug delivery systems (TDDSs) are designed to deliver drug precisely to the tumor site, enhancing ef\ufb01cacy and minimizing side effects. This is particularly important in treating ovarian cancer, which has a high mortality rate and poor prognosis due to extensive abdominal metastasis and late diagnosis [10]. The human repro- ductive system is prone to various infections, injuries, and physio- logical changes. Advanced drug delivery platforms can signi\ufb01cantly improve the treatment of these conditions by targeting speci\ufb01c cell populations or intracellular environments. TDDSs allow for con- trolled drug release, which is essential for maintaining therapeutic drug levels over extended periods. This is bene\ufb01cial in managing chronic conditions and reducing the frequency of drug administra- tion [10]. Advanced drug delivery approaches are being developed for biopharmaceuticals, including vaccines, antibiotics, nucleic acids, proteins, and peptides. These approaches can enhance the", "delivery and effectiveness of these complex molecules in the repro- ductive system. In ovarian cancer, chemoresistance is a signi\ufb01cant challenge. TDDSs can help overcome this by ensuring that higher concentrations of the drug reach the tumor site, thereby improving the overall treatment outcome. Advances in Drug Delivery to the Reproductive System 377 3 Challenges in Drug Delivery to the Reproductive System The challenges in drug delivery to the reproductive system are multifaceted and can signi\ufb01cantly impact the effectiveness of treat- ments for infertility and related conditions. One of the primary challenges is the anatomical and physiological barriers that drugs must overcome to reach their target sites within the female repro- ductive tract (FRT). The unique environment of the FRT, includ- ing its mucosal barriers and varying pH levels, can hinder the absorption and ef\ufb01cacy of therapeutic agents [11, 12]. For instance, traditional drug delivery methods often face limitations such as short contact time with the mucosa and variability in individual anatomy, which necessitate the development of innovative delivery systems [13]. The administration of drugs to the upper gastrointestinal tract (UGT) encounters multiple obstacles that can be categorized as anatomical, physiological, or behavioral. These challenges encom- pass the local epithelial barrier, the presence of drug transporters and metabolizing enzymes, the composition of the surrounding tissue (including immune cells), the in\ufb02uence of microbiota, the hormonal environment, the adequacy of blood supply and lym- phatic drainage, the existence of dynamic \ufb02uids with intricate com- positions, the necessity for sterility, the risk of non-target drug exposure, potential side effects, and the overall anatomical accessi", "onment, the adequacy of blood supply and lym- phatic drainage, the existence of dynamic \ufb02uids with intricate com- positions, the necessity for sterility, the risk of non-target drug exposure, potential side effects, and the overall anatomical accessi- bility of the region [14]. Financial barriers also pose signi\ufb01cant challenges to accessing infertility treatments. High costs associated with assisted reproduc- tive technologies (ART) and the lack of adequate insurance cover- age can lead to delays or discontinuation of therapy, particularly among low-income populations [15]. This economic aspect under- scores the need for health sector authorities to develop cost- effective solutions and improve access to ART services, ensuring that \ufb01nancial constraints do not prevent couples from receiving necessary treatments [15]. Drug delivery to the reproductive system faces several chal- lenges, including physiological barriers, the need for innovative delivery systems, and economic constraints. Addressing these issues through advancements in nanotechnology and policy changes can enhance the effectiveness of treatments for infertility and improve overall reproductive health outcomes.", "378 Dhaval J. Kamothi et al. Nanotechnology and other techniques has emerged as a promising solution to enhance drug delivery in reproductive health. The use of nanocarriers can improve the bioavailability of drugs while minimizing side effects, thereby creating more effective treatment regimens [12, 16]. These systems can be designed to release drugs in a controlled manner, targeting speci\ufb01c tissues within the reproductive system and potentially increasing the ther- apeutic outcomes for conditions such as endometriosis and uterine \ufb01broids [17]. Moreover, advancements in sol-gel formulations have shown potential for intravaginal drug delivery, offering a versatile platform for the administration of various therapeutic agents [11]. 4 Advances in Drug Delivery Systems The advanced drug delivery systems include use of delivery systems such as nanoparticles, liposomes, hydrogels and polymer gels, micro and nano needles and others (Fig. 1). 4.1 Nanotechnology- Based Delivery Systems Nanomedicine represents a biotechnological strategy for the deliv- ery of therapeutics, employing nanoparticles (NPs) to facilitate the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of various medical conditions [18]. Due to their nanoscale dimensions, speci\ufb01cally those measur- ing less than 100 nm, NPs exhibit unique properties that allow for targeted drug delivery and protection of therapeutic agents [19]. The functionalization of NP surfaces improves the selective targeting of particular cells or tissues, while the encapsulation of therapeutic agents minimizes metabolic degradation and extends Fig. 1 Representative images of the different advanced drug delivery systems", "es metabolic degradation and extends Fig. 1 Representative images of the different advanced drug delivery systems", "their bioavailability [20]. A range of NPs has been effectively uti- lized as delivery systems in therapeutic approaches aimed at addres- sing numerous disorders related to reproductive health. Advances in Drug Delivery to the Reproductive System 379 One study demonstrated the successful encapsulation of the estrogen metabolite 2-methoxyoestradiol within nanoparticles composed of poly(sebacic acid)-co-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) [21]. This metabolite is known to induce apoptosis in tumor cells. In vitro studies on human leiomyoma (\ufb01broid) cells revealed that these nanoparticles (NPs) led to cellular degradation and subsequent cell death. The controlled and sustained release of the drug from the NPs mitigated the risk of abrupt release spikes, resulting in prolonged therapeutic effects. These results indicate the potential application of NPs in the management of \ufb01broids. The administration of pharmacological agents during preg- nancy presents considerable risks to both the mother and fetus, thereby constraining treatment options for gestational conditions. Nanoparticles have emerged as a promising solution to these chal- lenges, enabling targeted delivery of therapeutics across the pla- centa in complex pregnancy scenarios. Additionally, NPs have been employed in the treatment of ectopic pregnancies. Bacteria-derived nanoparticles were engineered, referred to as \u201cEnGeneIC delivery vehicles,\u201d which were modi\ufb01ed with antibodies that speci\ufb01cally target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) prevalent in placental cells [22]. These NPs were loaded with the chemothera- peutic agent doxorubicin (DOX) to inhibit the proliferation of trophoblastic cells, thereby effectively preventing the progression of ectopic pregnancies. Further investigations have highlighted the potent", ". These NPs were loaded with the chemothera- peutic agent doxorubicin (DOX) to inhibit the proliferation of trophoblastic cells, thereby effectively preventing the progression of ectopic pregnancies. Further investigations have highlighted the potential of NPs for selective therapeutic delivery to the placenta in animal models. This can be achieved through the infusion of NPs into the umbilical cord, amniotic sac, or directly into the placenta. For instance, a peptide that binds to placental chondroitin sulfate A has been utilized to guide drug-loaded NPs to the placenta, minimizing adverse effects on the embryo while enhancing drug ef\ufb01cacy and absorption by placental tissues [23]. 4.2 Liposomes Liposomes, which are a type of nanocarrier, improve the stability and distribution of therapeutic agents by forming phospholipid vesicles that consist of a lipid bilayer encasing an aqueous core. They are characterized by their biocompatibility, customizable fea- tures, and the ability to achieve targeted delivery through the attachment of speci\ufb01c ligands [24]. In reproductive health care, liposomes play a crucial role in enhancing drug bioavailability and extending half-life by acting as a shield against immune detection [25]. They hold signi\ufb01cant potential for targeted therapies in cancers such as breast, ovarian, and prostate, as well as in HIV treatment and the management of preterm labor. For instance, immunoliposomes have been", "developed to deliver doxorubicin (DOX) speci\ufb01cally to malignant breast cells that overexpress the human estrogen receptor (HER2), utilizing conjugation with anti-HER2 antibodies. This strategy has shown effectiveness in selectively targeting HER2-positive breast cancer cells and promoting ef\ufb01cient intracellular drug delivery in animal studies [26]. 380 Dhaval J. Kamothi et al. Moreover, a novel approach involves cationic liposomes, par- ticularly EndoTAG-1, which is loaded with paclitaxel for the treat- ment of advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). This technique has yielded encouraging results in Phase II clinical trials with 140 TNBC patients, where the use of paclitaxel (Taxol) via EndoTAG-1 led to signi\ufb01cant tumor growth inhibition and was well-tolerated by the subjects [27]. Additionally, studies have shown that antibodies targeting the oxytocin receptor (OTR) have a strong af\ufb01nity for these receptors, which are abundant in placental decidual tissues [28]. This discov- ery has enabled the creation of immunoliposomes conjugated with OTR antibodies for the treatment of preterm labor, allowing for the targeted delivery of anti-contraction medications such as nifed- ipine, salbutamol, and rolipram [29]. This method has been effec- tive in pregnant mouse models, facilitating precise drug targeting to the placenta, delaying delivery, and showing no signs of trans- placental transport to the fetus [30]. 4.3 Hydrogels and Biodegradable Polymers Polymer gels are solid conjugates of polymers and electrolytes that possess mechanical properties similar to traditional polymers while also maintaining the ionic conductivity typical of liquid electrolytes.

One notable application of polymer gels is in the treatment of ovarian cancer in animal models, where a hydrogel depot made from photocured glycol chitosan and loaded with paclitaxel was utilized. This hydrogel was able to release paclitaxel steadily over 7 days while preserving its structural integrity and effectively inhi- biting tumor growth [31]. Moreover, polymer gels are also utilized in addressing erectile dysfunction, particularly in the form of microemulsion gels. These gels are considered effective DDS due to their ease of preparation, thermodynamic stability, capability to penetrate cell membranes, high bioavailability, and signi\ufb01cant drug-loading capacity [32]. In a research, a microemulsion gel containing sildena\ufb01l citrate was created using isopropyl myristate for transdermal delivery [33]. When evaluated on a human skin \ufb01broblast cell line, the gel demonstrated substantial skin permeation without causing cytotox- icity. Additionally, the sildena\ufb01l-loaded gel maintained good physi- cal and chemical stability over a 6-month duration, suggesting its potential as a promising option for the topical treatment of erectile dysfunction.", "Advances in Drug Delivery to the Reproductive System 381 4.4 Injectable and Implantable Devices Nanomaterials exhibit signi\ufb01cant potential in the domains of con- traception and fertility regulation. NPs can serve as carriers for contraceptive agents, thereby enhancing the ef\ufb01cacy of birth con- trol methods. By encapsulating or modifying these agents with NPs, it is possible to establish controlled release mechanisms that improve drug stability and bioavailability. Subcutaneous contraceptive implants, which utilize biodegrad- able materials, involve the integration of hormones with various biomaterial con\ufb01gurations, such as capsules or rods. These implants are placed beneath the skin to facilitate continuous and stable drug release, providing a long-lasting contraceptive effect with notable reversibility. A single implant can offer effective contraception for up to 5 years [34], exhibiting a very low failure rate, and allowing for the complete restoration of fertility upon removal. Another example of an implantable contraceptive is the extended-release delivery system known as Implanon, which employs ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA) as the carrier matrix [35]. EVA is characterized by its exceptional elasticity, \ufb02exibility, water resis- tance, and corrosion resistance, as well as its superior compatibility with \ufb01llers compared to silicone rubber. Additionally, research has demonstrated the effectiveness of a hydrogel delivery system composed of a blend of polyethylene vinyl acetate (PEVA) and polylactic acid (PLA), which incorporates hydrophilic tenofovir. By carefully adjusting the ratio of PLA to PEVA, researchers achieved optimal performance for long-acting, slow-release applications aimed at contraception, pregnancy pre- vention, and the inhibition of HIV transmission [36].

By carefully adjusting the ratio of PLA to PEVA, researchers achieved optimal performance for long-acting, slow-release applications aimed at contraception, pregnancy pre- vention, and the inhibition of HIV transmission [36]. 4.5 Micro- and Nano-Needles Microneedle (MN) delivery systems present a viable alternative to traditional subcutaneous injections, offering a painless application method and the potential for self-administration [37]. MNs, which have diameters ranging from 50 to 2000 \u03bcm, can penetrate the stratum corneum without causing pain and are particularly effective for transdermal drug delivery, especially for biomolecules [38]. Polymeric MNs, which can be loaded with therapeutic agents, have been extensively researched due to their high drug-loading capacity and biodegradability [39, 40]. However, drug-loaded MNs alone do not completely prevent the enzymatic degradation of peptides within the skin. Recent advancements in drug delivery technologies have intro- duced nanoparticles (NPs) as protective carriers that can shield drugs from enzymatic degradation [41]. Nanoparticle- encapsulated microneedles (NPs-MNs) have emerged as innovative tools for the combined treatment of various conditions, including diabetes, cancer, dermatological disorders, and for enhancing immune responses [42, 43]. In these systems, NPs are typically synthesized using polymers, freeze-dried, and then incorporated into a water-soluble polymer matrix to form the MNs. However,", "the stability of the NPs can be compromised by high temperatures or interactions with polymers during the manufacturing process [44, 45]. 382 Dhaval J. Kamothi et al. A study highlighted that triptorelin is a critical medication utilized in assisted reproductive technology (ART) [46]. Nonethe- less, the low bioavailability and the frequent requirement for sub- cutaneous injections of triptorelin can adversely affect the quality of life for women preparing for pregnancy. The study suggests the use of silk \ufb01broin (SF)-based microneedles (MNs) for the transdermal delivery of triptorelin-loaded NPs, which may enhance the bioavail- ability of the medication and facilitate safe and effective self- administration. 4.6 Spermbots In 2013, the initial sperm-based biohybrid micro-robot was engi- neered by integrating a motile sperm cell with a rolled-up magnetic microtube, which can be manipulated via an external magnetic \ufb01eld [47]. This innovation, referred to as the \u201cspermbot,\u201d has paved the way for the exploration of novel applications within the domain of assisted reproductive technology (ART). Over the last decade, signi\ufb01cant advancements have been made in the design and optimi- zation of various spermbots or sperm-like nanorobots. The term \u201cspermbot\u201d is de\ufb01ned as a biohybrid microrobot propelled by sperm cells [48]. Five fundamental types of nano-components have been developed for the fabrication of spermbots, which include microtubes, microhelices, tetrapod microtubes, rice grain- shaped (or spindle-type) nanoparticles, and complex nanocarriers (Fig. 2). Spermbot signify a notable progression in ART.

Spermbot signify a notable progression in ART. These sophis- ticated devices harness the natural motility of sperm cells, combin- ing them with arti\ufb01cial structures to form hybrid micromotors capable of targeted delivery and improved fertilization techniques. The potential applications of spermbots in assisted reproduction are extensive, encompassing enhancements in fertilization rates and the direct delivery of therapeutic agents to reproductive tissues. A key advantage of spermbots is their capacity to traverse the female reproductive tract, utilizing the inherent propulsion abilities of sperm. This characteristic facilitates precise targeting of oocytes, which is particularly advantageous in instances of male infertility characterized by compromised sperm motility. Research has indi- cated that spermbots can be remotely controlled through external magnetic \ufb01elds, allowing for the directed movement of sperm to speci\ufb01c sites within the reproductive system [49]. This functionality not only improves fertilization ef\ufb01ciency but also creates opportu- nities for drug delivery to address conditions such as ovarian cancer, where sperm-hybrid micromotors have demonstrated ef\ufb01cacy in transporting therapeutic agents [50].", "Advances in Drug Delivery to the Reproductive System 383 Fig. 2 Different types of spermbots fabricated for assisted fertilization and treatment of diseases 5 Route-Speci\ufb01c Delivery Approaches Signi\ufb01cant advancements have been made globally in enhancing the delivery of therapeutics, particularly through various administra- tion methods and delivery systems. The vaginal route has emerged as a promising option due to its unique anatomical and physiologi- cal properties. A primary advantage of vaginal drug delivery systems (VDDS) is their ability to avoid \ufb01rst-pass metabolism, which is particularly bene\ufb01cial for medications targeting disorders of the female genital tract [51]. VDDS facilitate the direct administration of therapeutics to the uterus, leveraging the uterine \ufb01rst-pass effect. This mechanism is advantageous for treating various conditions of the reproductive tract while minimizing systemic absorption of the drugs, thereby reducing potential side effects [52]. The representa- tion of the different delivery systems used for different reproductive disorders is shown in Fig. 3. 5.1 Vaginal and Cervical Delivery Anatomically, the vagina provides a large surface area and is rich in blood vessels, which supports ef\ufb01cient systemic circulation [53]. Upon absorption, drugs enter the venous plexus, draining into the internal iliac veins and subsequently passing through the hemorrhoidal veins before reaching the peripheral circulation. This", "pathway enhances drug concentrations in the bloodstream, thereby improving therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy. 384 Dhaval J. Kamothi et al. Fig. 3 Representation of the different delivery systems used for different reproductive disorders A diverse array of drug formulations has been developed for vaginal delivery, targeting conditions such as microbial infections, sexually transmitted diseases, cancers, endometriosis, and pregnancy-related disorders. These formulations are also employed in hormonal therapy, contraception, labor induction, and vaginal lubrication [54]. Recent innovations in VDDS have focused on prolonging the retention time of drugs within the vaginal cavity. Researchers have utilized smart bioadhesive polymers that respond to environmental stimuli, such as pH and temperature changes, within the vaginal milieu. These polymers effectively adhere to vaginal mucus and regulate the release of therapeutics from nanoformulations. Cur- rent developments in novel VDDS include nanoemulsions, vaginal \ufb01lms, liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, nano\ufb01bers, and mucoad- hesive polymers (Table 1). Cervical cancer remains a leading cause of mortality among women, with conditions such as cervicitis and cervical erosion identi\ufb01ed as signi\ufb01cant risk factors. Although local treatments can be effective, the deep anatomical location of the cervix, along with its mucus-covered and smooth mucosal surface, presents challenges for the effective administration of therapeutic agents.

To address these challenges, a novel cervical position- ing drug delivery system (CPDDS) has been developed utilizing hydrogel microspheres (HMs) derived from Bletilla striata polysac- charide (BSP). The HMs leverage the hydrophilic long chains of BSP, resulting in a microporous, circular structure that enhances \ufb02owability and water absorption. This design facilitates improved distribution across the cervical mucosa, effectively overcoming the mucus barrier and promoting optimal mucoadhesion. The HMs are engineered to provide controlled drug release with minimal initial burst and sustained delivery, making them suitable for local treat- ment applications. Additionally, the natural biodegradability of BSP reduces the risk of irritation and allergic reactions, highlighting the potential of BSP-based HMs as an effective CPDDS for clinical implementation [70]. 386 Dhaval J. Kamothi et al. In the realm of personalized medicine, 3D-printed scaffolds are increasingly utilized for the delivery of therapeutic proteins in the treatment of infections, genetic disorders, and cancers. Traditional drug-loading techniques, such as soaking or encapsulation, fre- quently result in rapid drug release. To overcome this limitation, a strategy for controlled, long-term protein release has been devel- oped. This approach involves the use of custom 3D-printed scaf- folds embedded with drug-laden microspheres to deliver anti- human papillomavirus (anti-HPV) proteins following cervical can- cer surgery. These scaffolds not only provide structural support but also facilitate localized drug release, while the microspheres protect the proteins from degradation and ensure sustained release throughout the necessary treatm", "owing cervical can- cer surgery. These scaffolds not only provide structural support but also facilitate localized drug release, while the microspheres protect the proteins from degradation and ensure sustained release throughout the necessary treatment duration [71]. 5.2 Uterine and Intrauterine Delivery Intrauterine devices (IUDs) and intrauterine balloon systems rep- resent established methodologies for intrauterine drug delivery. Among these, hormonal and copper IUDs are extensively researched for their ef\ufb01cacy in addressing various conditions affect- ing the female urogenital tract (UGT), including unintended preg- nancies, dysmenorrhea, endometriosis, uterine \ufb01broids, and adenomyosis [72]. Hormonal IUDs are generally constructed from polymers featuring a core-sheath or matrix design, often incorporating a rate-limiting polymer that functions as a semiper- meable barrier or is integrated within the matrix. These devices are engineered for prolonged drug release, which can extend from several months to years [73], typically exhibiting an initial phase of linear release followed by a gradual decline. Copper and levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs are frequently utilized as long-acting contraceptive methods. Additionally, levonorgestrel IUDs have been applied in the management of various UGT disorders, includ- ing endometriosis, endometritis, dysmenorrhea, and adenomyosis [74]. Other therapeutic agents, such as steroids, anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs, and chemotherapeutic agents, have also been administered", "via IUDs. For instance, using 3D printing technology to develop IUDs that contain progesterone (P4) and \ufb02uorouracil to treat ovarian and endometrial malignancies enables customized drug combinations and dosages to meet the needs of each patient [75]. Advances in Drug Delivery to the Reproductive System 387 In addition to IUDs, balloon uterine systems, such as Foley catheters, have been employed as physical barriers to mitigate intra- uterine adhesions (IUAs). These systems are available in various con\ufb01gurations, including heart-shaped designs [76], to facilitate optimal placement within the uterine cavity. They can also be infused with drugs, cells, and growth factors (GFs) to promote wound healing and enhance clinical outcomes. However, these delivery systems are not without limitations, which include the necessity for insertion by healthcare professionals, dif\ufb01culties in drug loading, potential patient discomfort, risks of device expul- sion, migration to adjacent pelvic organs, and the possibility of organ perforation [77]. 5.3 Penile and Testicular Delivery The direct administration of treatments to the penis or testes for the management of reproductive disorders is an active area of investigation. These methodologies aim to address underlying pathophysiological issues more effectively, minimize systemic side effects, and improve therapeutic outcomes. Avana\ufb01l, a phosphodi- esterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor, functions by inhibiting the deg- radation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), leading to the relaxation of smooth muscle in the penile vasculature and enhancement of erectile function. However, its clinical ef\ufb01cacy is constrained by its low aqueous solubility [78]. To overcome this limitation, avana\ufb01l was encapsulated in solid nanoparticles and incorporated ", "oth muscle in the penile vasculature and enhancement of erectile function. However, its clinical ef\ufb01cacy is constrained by its low aqueous solubility [78]. To overcome this limitation, avana\ufb01l was encapsulated in solid nanoparticles and incorporated them into a chitosan-based transdermal \ufb01lm [79]. This formulation was evaluated on rat skin and demonstrated successful drug permeation, suggesting a viable alternative to oral administration with improved bioavailability. Nitric oxide (NO) plays a crucial role in the erectile process by promoting smooth muscle relaxation and increasing blood \ufb02ow to the penis. Topical gel was developed containing three erectogenic agents\u2014two PDE5 inhibitors (tadala\ufb01l and sialorphin) and NO\u2014 loaded onto NPs [80]. In experiments using a murine model with an anesthetized penis, the gel effectively induced erections, indicat- ing the potential of NPs as a delivery system for multiple pharma- cological agents aimed at treating erectile dysfunction through topical application. This strategy may mitigate the adverse effects associated with oral medications and avoid hepatic metabolism. Sildena\ufb01l, another PDE5 inhibitor, is typically administered orally; however, it is linked to side effects such as hypotension and arrhythmias, as well as challenges related to bioavailability and delayed onset of action. To address these issues, researchers are investigating alternative topical delivery methods. One study employed bilosomes\u2014liposomes modi\ufb01ed with bile salts\u2014as a", "delivery vehicle for sildena\ufb01l. This modi\ufb01cation enhances both molecular stability and transdermal absorption. In ex vivo studies, sildena\ufb01l-loaded liposomes achieved a penetration rate of 39% within 15 min, and in murine models, a dosage of 2 mg/kg resulted in increased potency within 10 min [81]. 388 Dhaval J. Kamothi et al. Intracavernosal injection of medications, such as alprostadil (a vasodilator), is another approach used to induce erections, par- ticularly in men unresponsive to oral therapies for erectile dysfunc- tion. Additionally, intracavernosal delivery of substances like stem cells or growth factors is being explored for penile rehabilitation following surgical procedures or for the treatment of Peyronie\u2019s disease, characterized by penile curvature due to \ufb01brous scar tissue [82]. Hormonal therapies can also be administered directly to the testes to regulate testosterone production or spermatogenesis. For instance, gonadotropins such as human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) may be utilized in men experiencing infertility due to hypogonadism [83]. Further- more, the potential of stem cell therapy and gene therapy for addressing testicular dysfunction is under investigation as a means to restore fertility and enhance hormonal function in cases of testicular injury. 6 Targeted and Precision Medicine Approaches 6.1 Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) plays a signi\ufb01cant role in managing infertility by regulating menstrual cycles, promoting ovulation, and enhancing the likelihood of conception. A balanced combination of estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) is often employed to create an optimal environment for pregnancy, partic- ularly in women with a uterus. The use of progesterone is crucial in", " and enhancing the likelihood of conception. A balanced combination of estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) is often employed to create an optimal environment for pregnancy, partic- ularly in women with a uterus. The use of progesterone is crucial in mitigating the risk of endometrial hyperplasia that may arise from unopposed estrogen therapy [84]. The balance between E2 and P4 is essential for ensuring successful implantation and the mainte- nance of pregnancy, as both hormones in\ufb02uence critical reproduc- tive physiological processes [85]. An individualized approach to HRT is necessary, taking into account the patient\u2019s medical history, hormone levels, and speci\ufb01c reproductive goals, to optimize outcomes and minimize potential risks [84]. The American Menopause Society emphasizes the importance of combining E2 and P4 in women with a uterus to prevent complications such as endometrial hyperplasia [84]. Addi- tionally, research underscores that the timing and dosage of HRT can signi\ufb01cantly impact fertility outcomes, with a proper E2 to P4 ratio associated with improved success rates in assisted reproductive technologies [85].", "Advances in Drug Delivery to the Reproductive System 389 HRT, although not primarily indicated as a treatment for infer- tility, offers multiple bene\ufb01ts in regulating reproductive hormones, making it a valuable strategy for enhancing fertility, especially when individualized to the patient\u2019s speci\ufb01c needs [86]. 6.2 Gene Therapy and RNA-Based Approaches Nanotechnology, an advanced \ufb01eld of science, holds signi\ufb01cant potential in genetic modi\ufb01cation, editing, and repair, particularly in addressing infertility-related genetic defects. By leveraging the unique surface properties of nanoparticles, researchers have devel- oped innovative methods to deliver therapeutic agents or genes into reproductive cells with high precision, thereby enabling tar- geted gene manipulation. For example, lipid nanoparticle encapsu- lating CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing tools were synthesized. This formulation successfully inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in hr-HPV9E/E16-positive cervical cancer SiHa cells by deactivating the HPV16 oncogene [87]. Similarly, lipid nano- particles that encapsulate PLK1-targeting Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA gene-editing tools were prepared [88]. This breakthrough facili- tated the development of a murine model of peritoneal disseminated ovarian cancer, with nanoparticles administered via intraperitoneal injection to achieve gene editing at the target site. Furthermore, broader applications of nanotechnology in reproduction, including gene editing, repair, imaging, and diag- nostics, were explored. Beyond reproduction, this technology has shown potential in viral infection management [89]. The synaptosome-associated 23-kDa protein (SNAP-23), a plasma membrane protein, plays a crucial role in the transportation of HIV viral vesicles [90]. The absence of SNAP-23 in", ", this technology has shown potential in viral infection management [89]. The synaptosome-associated 23-kDa protein (SNAP-23), a plasma membrane protein, plays a crucial role in the transportation of HIV viral vesicles [90]. The absence of SNAP-23 in host cells leads to defective HIV-1 particle synthesis, which could be har- nessed as a genetic strategy for preventing HIV transmission. A \ufb01lm platform using PEGylated poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid)/poly- ethylenimine nanoparticles was developed to deliver siRNA target- ing dendritic cells, effectively knocking down SNAP-23 [91]. These siRNA-loaded nanoparticles, when tested on vaginal epithelial cells in vitro, exhibited ef\ufb01cient release and selective targeting, offering a promising approach to HIV prevention. 6.3 Personalized Medicine in Reproductive Disorders Personalized or precision medicine is increasingly applied in repro- ductive medicine to customize treatments based on an individual\u2019s unique genetic makeup, health history, and lifestyle factors [92]. This approach has long been integrated into reproductive care, particularly in techniques such as preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) and preimplantation genetic screening (PGS), which assess the genetic health of embryos before implantation. The primary objective of reproductive medicine is to assist infertile couples in achieving healthy pregnancies, especially for those affected by genetic disorders. While traditional assisted reproduc- tive technologies (ART) can address infertility issues such as tubal", "blockages, they may be inadequate for cases involving genetic abnormalities. PGD/PGS helps by identifying these genetic issues, particularly aneuploidy\u2014an abnormal number of chromosomes\u2014 which can affect up to 80% of embryos in women over 41, leading to IVF failure [93, 94]. 390 Dhaval J. Kamothi et al. The evolution of screening technologies, from \ufb02uorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), which was limited to detecting only a few chromosomes, to newer methods like array comparative geno- mic hybridization (array-CGH), single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays, and next-generation sequencing (NGS), now allows for a comprehensive examination of all 24 chromosomes. These advanced techniques signi\ufb01cantly improve the accuracy of identifying aneuploidy and increase pregnancy success rates [95]. NGS has emerged as a cost-effective, precise tool, not only for selecting healthy embryos but also for screening for single-gene disorders. The integration of technologies like mutated allele revealed by sequencing with aneuploidy and linkage analyses (MARSALA), which combines NGS with single-cell genome ampli\ufb01cation, enhances the ability to simultaneously detect aneu- ploidy, genetic mutations, and mitochondrial abnormalities with high accuracy [96]. This advancement has streamlined the PGD/PGS process, improving diagnostic precision and success rates in ART procedures. Additionally, the endometrium undergoes a brief window of implantation (WOI), typically between days 19 and 21 of the menstrual cycle, during which it becomes receptive to embryo implantation. This tissue undergoes dynamic structural changes in response to steroid hormones, creating a favorable environment for blastocyst attachment [97, 98]. Accurate identi\ufb01cation of this win- dow is crucial to prevent reproduc", "tive to embryo implantation. This tissue undergoes dynamic structural changes in response to steroid hormones, creating a favorable environment for blastocyst attachment [97, 98]. Accurate identi\ufb01cation of this win- dow is crucial to prevent reproductive failure due to improper timing. The endometrial receptivity array (ERA), a genomic diag- nostic tool, was developed to determine the precise WOI by analyz- ing the expression of 238 genes. By comparing a patient\u2019s genetic pro\ufb01le with reference samples from natural or hormone replace- ment cycles, the ERA helps identify the optimal timing for embryo transfer, improving implantation success and pregnancy rates, par- ticularly for those with recurrent implantation failure [99, 100]. Thus, the application of personalized medicine in reproductive care addresses the complexities of infertility and enhances the ef\ufb01- cacy of ART, particularly as the number of individuals experiencing fertility issues continues to rise. The ability to customize treatment based on a comprehensive understanding of each patient\u2019s unique biological characteristics allows for more precise interventions, leading to improved outcomes in reproductive medicine.", "Advances in Drug Delivery to the Reproductive System 391 7 Therapeutic Applications and Innovations 7.1 Infertility and Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) Assisted reproductive technology (ART) comprises a variety of laboratory methodologies designed to assist couples experiencing infertility in achieving conception, primarily through procedures such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). A novel approach to enhance the outcomes of ART involves the utilization of nanoparticles (NPs) for the targeted delivery of pharmaceuticals, enzymes, or biomolecules directly into gametes, which may potentially increase success rates. For example, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNPs) have been employed in conjunction with the C105Y peptide, which is designed to selec- tively target and penetrate the sperm cell membrane without in\ufb02ict- ing damage, thereby preserving cellular integrity. Additional investigations have examined the application of NPs in ART within agricultural species. In a study conducted in 2020, the administra- tion of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone via chitosan-sodium tri- polyphosphate NPs resulted in enhanced bioavailability, even at merely 25% of the standard dosage [101]. Furthermore, chitosan- tripolyphosphate NPs have been employed as carriers for proges- terone in cattle, facilitating the regulation of hormonal cycles through a method known as spray-drying, achieving an encapsula- tion ef\ufb01ciency ranging from 69% to 75% for progesterone [102]. Additionally, successful loading and delivery of progesterone have been demonstrated using polylactic acid-based NPs [103] and polymethylmethacrylate-based NPs as delivery vehicles [104]. Nanoparticles have also exhibited potential in the preserva- tion of fertility in prepub", "oading and delivery of progesterone have been demonstrated using polylactic acid-based NPs [103] and polymethylmethacrylate-based NPs as delivery vehicles [104]. Nanoparticles have also exhibited potential in the preserva- tion of fertility in prepubescent males. The cryopreservation of immature testicular tissue frequently leads to a signi\ufb01cant loss of spermatogonial cells, which are the sole cells capable of undergoing spermatogenesis at this developmental stage, thereby considerably diminishing reproductive potential [105]. Alginate nanoparticle matrix was developed encapsulating a necrosis inhibitor factor and applied it to immature testis tissue derived from a nude mouse model [106]. Their \ufb01ndings indicated a signi\ufb01cant enhancement in germ cell integrity and graft survival, presenting promising opportunities for fertility preservation in human subjects. 7.2 Treatment of Reproductive Cancers Superparamagnetic iron oxides and aptamer-conjugated gold nanoparticles, referred to as \u201cnanotheranostic agents speci\ufb01c to prostate cancer,\u201d have been employed as diagnostic modalities for prostate cancer. These nanoparticles are designed to encapsulate the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin (DOX) and leverage image-guided therapy to selectively target malignant prostate cells. This approach enhances the therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy while mini- mizing systemic toxicity [107]. A multitude of studies has validated the effectiveness of liposomes as drug delivery vehicles for targeting", "prostate cancer. One strategy involves the co-encapsulation of DOX and simvastatin\u2014an established lipid-lowering agent with anticancer properties\u2014within herceptin-targeted liposomes [ ], which exhibit a high af\ufb01nity for HER2 receptors present on prostate tumor cells [ ]. This method has demonstrated a signi\ufb01cant reduction in tumor growth, likely attributable to its anti- angiogenic properties, indicating a promising avenue for prostate cancer therapy [ ]. Furthermore, considering that prostate can- cer cells overexpress cyclooxygenase-2 and glucose transporter-1, both of which are implicated in cancer progression [ ]. One study proposed a multifunctional liposomal carrier incorporating celecoxib and genistein [ ]. This combination effectively targets prostate cancer cells and induces apoptosis. These \ufb01ndings under- score the potential of liposomes as effective drug delivery systems in the battle against prostate cancer. Paclitaxel, another potent che- motherapeutic agent, targets the cytoskeleton of cancer cells by stabilizing microtubules within the mitotic spindle, thereby pre- venting their disassembly and disrupting chromosomal alignment during metaphase spindle assembly. Paclitaxel was encapsulated within poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles and demonstrated targeted delivery to endometrial cells in a xenograft model, effec- tively inhibiting tumor growth [ ]. Additionally, various nano- particles, including bovine serum albumin [ ], gold [ ], and magnetic iron [ ], have been conjugated with speci\ufb01c ligands such as folate [ ] and follicle-stimulating hormone receptor- binding peptides to facilitate the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to reproductive cancers, including ovarian and uterine can- cer. Numerous investigations have explored the application of ", "as folate [ ] and follicle-stimulating hormone receptor- binding peptides to facilitate the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to reproductive cancers, including ovarian and uterine can- cer. Numerous investigations have explored the application of nanoparticles as delivery systems for reproductive malignancies. For example, the encapsulation of the chemotherapeutic agent epigallocatechin 3-gallate within polysaccharide nanoparticles has been studied for its potential in treating prostate cancer [ ]. However, these methodologies necessitate further clinical trials to assess their ef\ufb01cacy in human subjects. Several liposomes have shown promise in effectively targeting ovarian cells and deliv- ering encapsulated therapeutics. In a murine model, nickel- chelating liposomes linked to the recombinant protein ligand ErbB2 (also known as HER2) successfully targeted metastatic ovarian tumors that overexpress ErbB2, highlighting their potential for ovarian cancer treatment [ ]. Subsequent studies have rein- forced the feasibility of liposomes in managing ovarian cancer. Cell- penetrating peptides are frequently employed to modify the sur- faces of nanoparticles for targeted cellular delivery [ ]. Transfer- rin receptors, which are often overexpressed in various malignant cells, including those of ovarian cancer, serve as effective targets [ ]. In this context, liposomes were developed that were double- conjugated with the tumor-targeting, arginine-rich cell- penetrating peptide octa-arginine (R8) and transferrin to 121 120 119 118 117 116 115 114 113 112 111 110 109 108 392 Dhaval J.

These lipo- somes, loaded with DOX, achieved selective targeting of malignant cells and facilitated successful intracellular drug delivery. A correla- tion has been established between the expression levels of the CD44 cell membrane receptor and cancer progression, including ovarian cancer. In this regard, PEG-paclitaxel was loaded onto anti- CD44 antibody-decorated liposomes, effectively inhibiting the proliferation of CD44-positive ovarian cancer cells [123]. More- over, the conjugation of liposomes with plectin\u2014an abundant cytolinker expressed on the surface of ovarian cells during the transition from healthy to malignant tissue\u2014enhanced the selective targeting of these cancer cells [124]. When poly(ADP-ribose) poly- merase inhibitors, which are effective against BRCA1/2-expressing ovarian cancer cells [125], were loaded onto these modi\ufb01ed lipo- somes, they successfully targeted ovarian cancer cells and resulted in a substantial reduction in tumor size in a murine model. Advances in Drug Delivery to the Reproductive System 393 7.3 Infections and In\ufb02ammatory Conditions Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) serves as a crucial intervention for managing HIV infection; however, it necessitates lifelong adherence to medication, as HAART is unable to completely eradicate the virus from the host\u2019s system. In response to this limitation, researchers have created a nanoparticle-based strategy known as laser antiretroviral therapy, which facilitates the prolonged and controlled release of antiretroviral agents. This technique employs nanoparticles (NPs) to maintain the release of lamivudine, a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, thereby ensuring therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy for up to 30 days following a single administ", "olled release of antiretroviral agents. This technique employs nanoparticles (NPs) to maintain the release of lamivudine, a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, thereby ensuring therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy for up to 30 days following a single administration [126]. Furthermore, NPs have been explored for their potential in addressing various genital infections beyond HIV, with certain vaginal gels designed to mitigate the risk of viral infections such as human papillomavirus and herpes simplex virus. These gels operate on the premise that speci\ufb01c poly-anionic and peptide dendrimer NPs can competitively inhibit the binding of these pathogens to cellular receptors, thereby lowering the likeli- hood of infection [127]. Additionally, dendrimers have been inves- tigated as delivery vehicles for azithromycin in the treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis infections. Ongoing research has also examined the application of NPs in the development of vaccines against Chlamydia [128], the prevention of herpes simplex virus [129], and the management of vaginal candidiasis [130]. Neverthe- less, further investigations are warranted to evaluate the ef\ufb01cacy of NPs for these applications. Several liposomal formulations have achieved clinical approval and are currently utilized as drug delivery systems for various reproductive system malignancies, including ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and AIDS-related Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma. Notably, DOX-loaded PEGylated liposomes were the \ufb01rst to dem- onstrate clinical success in oncological therapy, enhancing the drug\u2019s ability to evade immune detection while prolonging its", "\u2019s ability to evade immune detection while prolonging its", "systemic circulation and allowing for a reduced dosage of doxoru- bicin (DOX). This delivery method consequently mitigates the systemic adverse effects commonly associated with DOX adminis- tration [131]. In the context of HIV treatment, a signi\ufb01cant obsta- cle remains the inability of current therapies to completely eliminate the virus from reservoir sites within the body, leading to persistent release of viral DNA into the bloodstream [132]. Stavudine, a potent antiviral agent employed in the treatment of HIV-1, func- tions by inhibiting viral DNA synthesis; however, its short half-life of 0.8\u20131.5 h necessitate frequent dosing, which can result in severe side effects such as neuropathy and lactic acidosis, thereby limiting its clinical application [133]. A novel approach was proposed encapsulating stavudine within gelatin nanoliposomes speci\ufb01cally targeting HIV reservoir sites [134]. This strategy allows for a signi\ufb01cantly reduced dosage of the antiviral agent while facilitating a linear and sustained release over a 12-h period, effectively reach- ing all reservoir sites. This innovative method has demonstrated a reduction in circulating viremia while concurrently decreasing the systemic complications associated with stavudine treatment. 394 Dhaval J. Kamothi et al. Endometriosis is a debilitating condition characterized by the aberrant growth of tissue that resembles the endometrial lining outside the uterine cavity, leading to considerable physical and psychological distress among women of reproductive age. Current therapeutic approaches primarily aim to alleviate symptoms through surgical intervention and hormonal treatments [135]. Nevertheless, recent investigations have examined the potential application of nanoparticles (NPs) in the management of endometriosis. ", "peutic approaches primarily aim to alleviate symptoms through surgical intervention and hormonal treatments [135]. Nevertheless, recent investigations have examined the potential application of nanoparticles (NPs) in the management of endometriosis. Two distinct studies have indicated that NPs may serve as effective vehicles for drug delivery to mitigate the condition. In one investigation, it was reported that the adminis- tration of chitosan nanoparticles encapsulating gene therapy in a rat model resulted in a reduction of endometrial lesion size and inhib- ited cyst formation [136]. In a separate study, it was illustrated that lipid nanoparticles, which exhibit structural similarities to human low-density lipoproteins (LDL), were effectively internalized by endometrial tissues [137]. These lipid nanoparticles present a promising avenue for targeted drug delivery to the affected regions, potentially providing an alternative to conventional surgical methods. 7.4 Contraceptive Technologies Nanomaterials present considerable promise for localized con- traceptive applications, including the modulation of the vaginal environment and the establishment of localized acidic conditions conducive to contraception. Previous research has demonstrated the ef\ufb01cacy of a PEVA-PLA hybrid hydrogel system in conjunction with polar tenofovir [36]. By varying the ratio of PLA to PEVA, researchers were able to achieve a prolonged, slow-release pro\ufb01le, indicating its potential utility in contraception, pregnancy", "prevention, and even the mitigation of HIV transmission. Biode- gradable nanoparticles were developed composed of poly(lactic acid) utilizing a single emulsion technique, resulting in an average particle size of 75 nm [138]. Upon introduction into the vaginal cavity of murine models, these nanoparticles migrated retrograde through the cervix and accumulated in the uterus. Subsequent analysis of uterine samples indicated the activation of pro-in\ufb02ammatory signals, such as RANTES and TNF, thereby creating an environment that inhibited successful pregnancy. Nano- materials are advantageous for impeding sperm motility, represent- ing a promising avenue for contraceptive strategies. By altering the surface morphology or chemical properties of nanoparticles, it is feasible to obstruct sperm binding and penetration of the oocyte, thus achieving contraceptive ef\ufb01cacy [139]. The contraceptive mechanism of copper intrauterine devices (IUDs) is believed to involve the release of Cu2+ ions, which incapacitate sperm and diminish myometrial contractions. Investigation was carried out for the application of nano-Cu/LDPE as a delivery system for copper in intrauterine devices [140]. Copper nanoparticles were incorporated into LDPE through various physical and chemical methods, resulting in a composite material with a uniform distribu- tion of nanoparticles. By modulating the spatial arrangement between the copper nanoparticles and LDPE, they were able to control the exposure to the corrosive medium (Cu2+ ions), facil- itating a rapid and consistent release rate within a 5-h timeframe [141]. The application of nanomaterials in contraceptive monitor- ing is an expanding area of research, presenting novel opportunities for enhanced fertility tracking. Nanoparticles can be utilized to label", "sistent release rate within a 5-h timeframe [141]. The application of nanomaterials in contraceptive monitor- ing is an expanding area of research, presenting novel opportunities for enhanced fertility tracking. Nanoparticles can be utilized to label speci\ufb01c physiological markers, enabling real-time monitoring of fertility indicators. For example, nanomaterials can be employed to label biomarkers such as FSH and LH [142, 143] to track ovulation cycles, thereby providing precise data on a woman\u2019s fertility status and aiding in the selection of appropriate contracep- tive methods or fertility planning approaches. Furthermore, nano- particle sensors can be employed to monitor hormone levels, including estrogen and progesterone, which assists in evaluating fertility, menstrual cycles, and hormonal imbalances [144, 145]. Additionally, nanotechnology can be leveraged for male contraception, where nanoparticles function as delivery sys- tems for contraceptive pharmaceuticals or spermicide agents within the male reproductive tract, thereby enabling controlled contracep- tive outcomes. Advances in Drug Delivery to the Reproductive System 395 8 Safety and Regulatory Considerations The advancement of novel drug delivery systems (NDDS) has signi\ufb01cantly transformed reproductive medicine by improving", "drug targeting, reducing systemic side effects, and enhancing ther- apeutic outcomes. Various NDDS types have been developed, including nanoparticle-based systems, hydrogels, microneedles, and implants or intrauterine devices [146]. These systems are employed for controlled contraceptive release, targeted therapy delivery to reproductive tumors, and hormone replacement treat- ments. However, like all emerging technologies, they present safety concerns that warrant careful consideration. Key issues include biocompatibility, targeting precision, and potential long-term adverse effects, particularly when applied to sensitive reproductive tissues such as the ovaries, uterus, or testes [147]. The materials used in NDDS must be compatible with these tissues to avoid complications like necrosis, in\ufb02ammation, or reproductive dysfunctions. 396 Dhaval J. Kamothi et al. Additionally, some delivery systems that administer hormones or hormone analogs may disrupt endocrine function, and pro- longed exposure to synthetic hormones could lead to long-term reproductive health complications [148]. Improper use of micro- needles can result in localized tissue damage or scarring, potentially affecting reproductive organs or functions. Hydrogels, if improp- erly formulated, may cause mucosal damage or infections after repeated use [149]. Although NDDS are designed to target speci\ufb01c areas, errors in delivery can lead to unintended effects on non-reproductive organs, causing systemic hormonal imbalances or damage to the liver or kidneys. In contraceptive applications, mistargeting could result in incomplete suppression of ovulation or sperm production, potentially leading to unintended pregnancies. For cancer treat- ments, off-target effects might impair fertility by damaging nearby healthy re", "eptive applications, mistargeting could result in incomplete suppression of ovulation or sperm production, potentially leading to unintended pregnancies. For cancer treat- ments, off-target effects might impair fertility by damaging nearby healthy reproductive tissues [150]. Long-term fertility impacts are also a concern with some NDDS, especially when drugs are deliv- ered via nanoparticles or implants, as they may irreversibly harm the ovaries or testes. Furthermore, certain materials or agents used in these systems may pose carcinogenic risks, particularly in reproduc- tive tissues with high cellular turnover [151]. However, ongoing efforts to develop more biocompatible, biodegradable materials for NDDS aim to mitigate these risks and minimize toxicity, tissue damage, and long-term complications. Tailoring NDDS to individ- ual genetic, hormonal, and reproductive pro\ufb01les could optimize treatment and reduce side effects [152]. Regulatory bodies, such as the US Food and Drug Administra- tion (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and the World Health Organization (WHO), are tasked with assessing the safety and ef\ufb01cacy of novel drugs and drug delivery systems [153]. In the USA, the FDA oversees the regulatory process, ensuring that stringent preclinical and clinical testing is conducted before new drug delivery technologies reach the market. Similarly, the EMA evaluates medicinal products in Europe to ensure", "compliance with safety and ef\ufb01cacy standards. In low- and middle- income countries, WHO provides guidelines to ensure the safety of drug delivery technologies [154]. Advances in Drug Delivery to the Reproductive System 397 Given the relative novelty of many NDDS, there is limited long-term data on their effects, especially on reproductive health, which necessitates thorough testing by regulatory agencies. The application of NDDS in fertility treatments or contraception also raises ethical considerations, particularly regarding potential long- term reproductive consequences and the manipulation of repro- ductive health for non-therapeutic purposes. Therefore, regulatory guidelines must ensure that clinical trial participants are fully informed of the risks and bene\ufb01ts associated with these new technologies. 9 Future Directions and Emerging Trends Advancements in arti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are revolutionizing various sectors, including healthcare and pharmaceuticals, by enabling researchers and clinicians to develop more precise, ef\ufb01cient, and personalized drug delivery systems. One signi\ufb01cant application of these technologies is in the design of reproductive drug delivery systems [155]. Reproductive drug delivery presents unique challenges due to the complex physiologi- cal processes involved, including those related to fertility, contra- ception, hormone regulation, and reproductive disorders. Traditional reproductive drug delivery methods often face limita- tions in ensuring consistent drug release and bioavailability [156]. AI and ML offer signi\ufb01cant bene\ufb01ts by optimizing drug delivery parameters, predicting patient-speci\ufb01c responses, and enhancing the overall effectiveness of reproductive therapies. Tech- niques such as predictive modeling,", "e and bioavailability [156]. AI and ML offer signi\ufb01cant bene\ufb01ts by optimizing drug delivery parameters, predicting patient-speci\ufb01c responses, and enhancing the overall effectiveness of reproductive therapies. Tech- niques such as predictive modeling, drug-target matching, and formulation optimization improve the performance and design of reproductive drug delivery systems [157]. Machine learning, in particular, has been instrumental in advancing research and clinical aspects of drug design. ML algo- rithms can analyze vast datasets to uncover patterns and correla- tions, enabling the simulation of drug release kinetics and absorption in speci\ufb01c tissues [158]. Moreover, ML is central to the development of nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems. Nanoparticles and nanocarriers, which enhance bioavailability and tissue targeting, are increasingly used in reproductive drug delivery. ML also facilitates virtual clinical trials, reducing the time and cost of bringing new reproductive drugs and delivery systems to the market [159]. The \ufb01elds of biotechnology and reproductive medicine are advancing rapidly, intersecting in key areas such as fertility treat- ments, genetic engineering, hormone therapy, and regenerative", "medicine. The integration of emerging biotechnologies is poised to transform reproductive healthcare, providing innovative solutions for challenges such as infertility, genetic disorders, and age-related reproductive decline [12]. This includes personalized fertility treat- ments, gene editing, stem cell therapies, and arti\ufb01cial gametes. As the understanding of genetics and molecular biology deepens, fertility treatments are increasingly personalized, with advances in genetic screening and AI-powered algorithms allowing for custo- mized treatment plans based on individual genetic pro\ufb01les [160]. Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) enables the screen- ing of embryos for genetic disorders during in vitro fertilization (IVF) [161]. 398 Dhaval J. Kamothi et al. Future biotechnological advancements will enable more com- prehensive genetic pro\ufb01ling, allowing for the detection of inherited conditions and traits that in\ufb02uence fertility. Pharmacogenomics will play a pivotal role in personalizing drug regimens in fertility treat- ments, optimizing medications for hormonal therapies and ovarian stimulants according to a patient\u2019s genetic pro\ufb01le. This precision reduces side effects and improves treatment ef\ufb01cacy [162]. Gene editing technologies, such as CRISPR-Cas9, offer the potential to correct genetic causes of infertility and prevent the transmission of hereditary diseases through assisted reproductive technologies (ART) [163]. Additionally, stem cell therapy and regenerative med- icine are opening new possibilities for treating infertility. One of the most promising developments is the generation of arti\ufb01cial gametes from stem cells, which could bene\ufb01t individuals unable to produce viable gametes due to conditions like premature ovarian failure or azoospermia [164]. This brea", "fertility. One of the most promising developments is the generation of arti\ufb01cial gametes from stem cells, which could bene\ufb01t individuals unable to produce viable gametes due to conditions like premature ovarian failure or azoospermia [164]. This breakthrough could revolutionize fertility preservation and treatment options [165]. The advancement of reproductive drug delivery systems neces- sitates interdisciplinary collaboration. The complexity of reproduc- tive medicine, which involves processes such as hormonal regulation and tissue-speci\ufb01c targeting, requires expertise from diverse \ufb01elds including pharmacology, biotechnology, chemistry, material science, engineering, and arti\ufb01cial intelligence. These mul- tidisciplinary efforts enhance the precision, safety, and accessibility of reproductive treatments, ultimately improving global reproduc- tive health outcomes. References 1.

Their nanoscale size and large surface area to volume ratio allow for enhanced interaction with biological systems, providing a platform for ef\ufb01cient drug loading and controlled release. Lipid-based nanoparticles, such as liposomes and solid lipid nanoparticles, offer biocompatibility and stability, ensuring sustained and targeted delivery with minimal toxicity. Polymeric nanoparticles, including dendrimers, enable the solubilization of hydrophobic drugs and precise control over drug release. Inorganic nanoparticles, like gold and silica nanoparticles, provide versatility in functionalization and targeted delivery, enhancing therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy. These systems signi\ufb01cantly reduce systemic side effects and improve the therapeutic index of orphan drugs, the drugs that are used to treat the rare diseases. Their ability to protect drugs from degradation ensures stability and prolonged activity, making them particularly suitable for complex and chronic conditions associated with rare diseases.

In the United States, the Orphan Drug Act of 1983 de\ufb01nes an RD as one that affects fewer than 200,000 indivi- duals [1]. Orphan drugs are medications or treatments developed speci\ufb01cally to treat these rare diseases, which often lack \ufb01nancial incentives for pharmaceutical companies due to the limited patient population. In Europe, a disease is considered rare if it affects no more than 1 in 2000 people [2]. Japan and Australia have similar de\ufb01nitions, often re\ufb02ecting the population size and healthcare policy structures [3]. While each RD affects a limited number of individuals, collectively, they affect approximately 300 million peo- ple worldwide [4]. Over 7000 RDs have been identi\ufb01ed, with Abhishek Pathak and Satya Pal Singh (eds.), Next-Generation Drug Delivery Systems, Methods in Pharmacology and Toxicology, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-4554-3_18, \u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025 407", "about 80% having genetic origins [4]. The prevalence of RDs varies widely; some conditions may affect only a handful of individuals globally, while others, like cystic \ufb01brosis or Duchenne muscular dystrophy, have higher incidence rates but still meet the rare disease criteria [5]. 408 Anil Kumar et al. Table 1 Rare diseases, number of global patients, and the cost of treatment Rare disease Orphan drug Est. global patients Cost (estimated yearly) Cystic \ufb01brosis Kalydeco/ Ivacaftor 70,000+ ~$300,000 Duchenne muscular dystrophy Exondys 51/Etplirsen 300,000+ ~$700,000 (high variation) Gaucher disease Zavesca/ Miglustat 60,000+ ~$200,000 (variable) Pompe disease Myozyme 10,000+ ~$800,000 (very high) Hunter syndrome Elaprase/ Idursulfase 1000+ ~$400,000 (extremely high) Niemann-pick disease type C Zavesca/ Miglustat 1200+ ~$400,000 (prohibitively expensive) Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (Hurler syndrome) Aldurazyme/ Laronidase 1 in 100,000 births ~$500,000 (extremely high) Spinal muscular atrophy type 1 Spinraza/ Nusinersen 10,000+ ~$750,000 (highest for any drug) The small number of patients poses a potential lack of market incentives, making it dif\ufb01cult for pharmaceutical companies to recoup their investments (Table 1) [6, 7]. The rarity of Fabry disease, affecting 1 in 40,000 to 1 in 60,000 males, underscores the economic challenges in developing new therapies (Table 1) [8\u2013 10]. The high cost of research and development, coupled with the necessity for extensive clinical trials, exacerbates the \ufb01nancial bur- den on these companies, making the return on investment uncer- tain [6, 11\u201313]. The development of orphan drugs is incentivized by various regulatory frameworks, such as the Orphan Drug Act in the United States, which provides bene\ufb01ts including tax credits, grant funding", "s, making the return on investment uncer- tain [6, 11\u201313]. The development of orphan drugs is incentivized by various regulatory frameworks, such as the Orphan Drug Act in the United States, which provides bene\ufb01ts including tax credits, grant funding, and market exclusivity for a certain period [14]. Sim- ilar incentives exist in the European Union and other regions to encourage pharmaceutical companies to invest in the research and development of treatments for rare diseases and orphan drugs [15]. Various drug delivery systems have been developed to deliver drugs (Table 2). A promising approach is the use of viral vectors in gene therapy, which introduces functional genes to correct genetic", "defects, offering a potential cure for inherited rare diseases such as spinal muscular atrophy and certain types of hemophilia [16, 17]. Advanced drug delivery techniques also include antibody-drug conjugates, which link potent drugs to antibodies that speci\ufb01cally target disease-causing cells, thus minimizing sys- temic side effects and improving the precision of rare disease thera- pies [18, 19]. One of the most innovative approaches involves the use of nanotechnology, which enhances drug solubility, stability, and bioavailability, thereby improving therapeutic outcomes [20, 21]. Liposomal delivery systems, for instance, encapsulate drugs in lipid bilayers, allowing for targeted delivery and reduced toxicity, which is particularly bene\ufb01cial for treating rare cancers [22, 23].

For example, liposomal nanoparticles have been utilized to deliver migalastat for the treatment of Fabry disease, improving its pharmacokinetic pro\ufb01le and reducing the frequency of dosing [25]. Furthermore, polymeric nanoparticles have been employed to deliver enzyme replacement therapies in lysosomal storage disorders, ensuring a sustained release and targeted delivery to affected tissues [26]. Polymeric nanoparticles have also been", "used for the delivery of asfotase alfa in hypophosphatasia, a rare metabolic disorder, providing a controlled release and enhanced stability of the drug [27, 28]. 410 Anil Kumar et al. Dendrimers, another type of nanoparticle, have shown poten- tial in the targeted delivery of drugs for rare diseases, such as cancer and genetic disorders, by loading drug molecules both in their interior and on surface groups, thus allowing controlled drug release [29, 30]. Mesoporous silica nanoparticles have been used to deliver bone morphogenetic proteins for the treatment of rare bone diseases, offering sustained release and improved bone regen- eration [31, 32]. One of the most promising applications of nano- particles is their use as drug-releasing support for neural diseases, capable of negotiating the blood-brain barrier. This barrier is a severe limitation for the delivery of potentially useful drugs; how- ever, it has been demonstrated that different drugs bound to nano- particles can be transported across the blood-brain barrier and achieve pharmacological effects in the brain, such as in brain tumor treatment [33, 34]. For instance, gold nanoparticles have been employed to deliver RNA therapeutics for the treatment of glioblastoma, showing signi\ufb01cant potential in improving drug delivery ef\ufb01ciency and reducing tumor growth [35, 36]. Nanotechnology-based delivery systems have been utilized for the delivery of siRNA in transthyretin amyloidosis, where nanopar- ticles have enhanced the stability and delivery ef\ufb01ciency of siRNA, thus improving therapeutic outcomes [37, 38]. Nanoparticle-based delivery systems have demonstrated substantial potential in improv- ing the pharmacokinetic pro\ufb01les and therapeutic indices of orphan drugs, thereby addressing the unique challenges associate", "mproving therapeutic outcomes [37, 38]. Nanoparticle-based delivery systems have demonstrated substantial potential in improv- ing the pharmacokinetic pro\ufb01les and therapeutic indices of orphan drugs, thereby addressing the unique challenges associated with treating rare diseases. 2 Liposomes Liposomes are spherical vesicles consisting of one or more phos- pholipid bilayers, which closely resemble the structure of cell mem- branes. They can encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic molecules, making them versatile carriers for various substances. These structures can vary in size from very small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) with diameters less than 100 nm to large multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) that can exceed 1 \u03bcm in diameter [38]. Unilamellar liposomes consist of a single lipid bilayer, while multilamellar lipo- somes have multiple concentric bilayers [39]. Common phospho- lipids used in liposome formulation include phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylserine [40]. Cholesterol is often included to modulate membrane \ufb02uidity and stability, preventing leakage of encapsulated drugs [40]. The surface charge of liposomes can be neutral, positively charged, or negatively charged, depending on the composition of the lipids", "used. Charged liposomes can be prepared by incorporating cationic or anionic lipids into the bilayer [41]. The charge in\ufb02uences lipo- some stability, interaction with biological membranes, and the encapsulation ef\ufb01ciency of charged molecules [41]. Drug Delivery in Rare Diseases: Orphan Drugs and Therapies 411 Liposomes have been extensively studied and utilized for a variety of purposes due to their biocompatibility, ability to encap- sulate diverse molecules, and capacity to deliver drugs to speci\ufb01c sites within the body. These bodies are widely used as drug delivery vehicles for both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs, improving the solubility, stability, and bioavailability of therapeutic agents [41]. They can provide targeted delivery to speci\ufb01c tissues, reduce systemic toxicity, and enhance therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy [42]. Liposomal formulations of chemotherapeutic agents, such as liposomal doxo- rubicin (Fig. 1a, b) and liposomal daunorubicin (DaunoXome), have been developed to reduce cardiotoxicity and enhance drug accumulation in tumor tissues through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [22]. Liposomal drug delivery systems have gained attention for their capability to encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs, protecting them from degradation and enhancing their therapeutic index [41]. A notable example is the use of liposomal amphotericin B, which has signi\ufb01cantly reduced the toxicity asso- ciated with conventional formulations in the treatment of fungal infections in immunocompromised patients [43]. Moreover, lipo- somal formulations have been successfully applied in delivering drugs for rare genetic disorders, such as liposomal cipro\ufb02oxacin for cystic \ufb01brosis-related lung infections [21]. A signi\ufb01cant challenge in developing many specialize", "3]. Moreover, lipo- somal formulations have been successfully applied in delivering drugs for rare genetic disorders, such as liposomal cipro\ufb02oxacin for cystic \ufb01brosis-related lung infections [21]. A signi\ufb01cant challenge in developing many specialized applica- tions of liposomes is the dif\ufb01culty in directing them to tissues where they typically do not accumulate [42]. As a result, extensive research has been dedicated to creating liposomes with targeting vectors attached to their bilayer surface [41]. These vectors include ligands such as oligosaccharides, peptides, proteins, and vitamins [44]. Most research has focused on antibody conjugates, as meth- ods for producing highly speci\ufb01c monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) are well established [45]. Ideally, liposomes could be delivered to any cell type if the cells are accessible to the carrier [46]. However, this is complicated by issues such as tissue access, competition, and rapid clearance [47]. Antibodies can become immunogenic when coupled to liposomes, though immunogenicity can be reduced by formulating the liposomes with the cytotoxic drug doxorubicin [48]. These challenges indicate that developing antibody-targeted liposomes for in vivo applications will be dif\ufb01cult [41]. Moreover, it is essential to understand the rationale behind attaching a targeted ligand. The basic concept is to crosslink liposomes, which react to form a permanent covalent bond when activated [49]. The most common method involves the reaction of sulfhydryl groups with maleimide groups, which is clean, fast, and ef\ufb01cient, and has been", "ast, and ef\ufb01cient, and has been", "adapted to modify all antibody functional groups in liposome con- jugates [50]. The choice of chemistry and modi\ufb01cation site should be based on compatibility with the speci\ufb01c antibody [42]. Different antibodies may react differently to various procedures, so multiple protocols might need to be tested [41]. The recommended general procedure involves thiolating antibodies with succinimidyl 3- (2-pyridyldithio) proprionate (SPDP), followed by deprotection with DTT (dithiothreitol (DDT) and conjugation to liposomes 412 Anil Kumar et al. Fig. 1 (a) Liposome as a drug carrier. (b) Liposomes delivering drugs to the cancerous cells", "containing maleimide-derivatized 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycerol-3- phosphoethanolamine (DSPE) or 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3- phosphoethanolamine (DPPE) [49]. It involves chemically mod- ifying IgG antibodies to attach them to liposomes. This process enhances the functionality of liposomes for targeted drug delivery and other therapeutic applications [51].

This technique has been effectively applied in the delivery of pegloticase for the treatment of chronic gout, signi\ufb01- cantly improving its pharmacokinetic properties and reducing immunogenicity [53]. It has been instrumental in the development of therapies for hemophilia, such as PEGylated recombinant factor VIII, which offers extended protection against bleeding episodes [54]. 3.8.1 Materials Required 1.

The concentration should be prepared such that when added to the liposome suspension, the \ufb01nal desired PEGylation percent- age is achieved (e.g., 5% molar ratio of DSPE-PEG2000 to total lipids). 3. Add the PEGylated lipid solution to the pre-formed liposome suspension slowly while stirring. 4. The volume of ethanol should not exceed 5% of the total volume to avoid disrupting the liposomes.", "416 Anil Kumar et al. 5. Incubate the mixture at a temperature suitable for the lipid phase transition (e.g., 37 \u00b0C) while stirring for 1\u20132 hours to ensure the insertion of PEGylated lipids into the liposome bilayer. 6. Ensure constant stirring to facilitate uniform distribution of the PEGylated lipids. 7. After the incubation, remove free PEGylated lipids and ethanol by dialyzing the liposome suspension against PBS (pH 7.4) using dialysis tubing with an appropriate molecular weight cut-off (e.g., 10,000 Da). 8. Dialyze for 24 h with frequent changes of the PBS to ensure complete removal of free PEGylated lipids and ethanol. 9. Measure the particle size and polydispersity index (PDI) using dynamic light scattering (DLS) to con\ufb01rm the integrity and uniformity of PEGylated liposomes. 10. Assess the surface charge (zeta potential) to con\ufb01rm successful PEGylation. PEGylated liposomes usually exhibit a slightly less negative or neutral zeta potential due to the shielding effect of PEG chains. 11. Verify the presence of PEG on the liposome surface by measur- ing the absorbance at speci\ufb01c wavelengths (e.g., 220 nm) using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. 3.9 Liposomal Doxorubicin (LD) LD is used in the treatment of rare cancers such as Kaposi\u2019s sar- coma. The encapsulation of doxorubicin in liposomes enhances drug delivery by improving targeting to tumor tissues while reduc- ing systemic exposure and associated toxicities [55]. Liposomes preferentially accumulate in tumor tissues due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [41]. The use of LD signi\ufb01cantly reduces cardiotoxicity, a common adverse effect asso- ciated with conventional doxorubicin therapy [55]. The liposomal encapsulation alters the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin, resulting in prolonged circulation tim", "t [41]. The use of LD signi\ufb01cantly reduces cardiotoxicity, a common adverse effect asso- ciated with conventional doxorubicin therapy [55]. The liposomal encapsulation alters the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin, resulting in prolonged circulation time and reduced peak plasma concentra- tions, thereby minimizing damage to cardiac tissues [41]. LD is administered intravenously, allowing the liposomes to circulate through the bloodstream and gradually release the encapsulated doxorubicin at the tumor site [22]. This targeted delivery system enhances the therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy of doxorubicin while minimizing adverse effects on healthy tissues [55]. Clinical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of LD in treating Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma, with improved response rates and reduced toxicity compared to conventional doxorubicin [56]. Patients treated with LD have shown signi\ufb01cant tumor regression and better tolerability [56]. Doxorubicin is typically loaded into liposomes using a pH gradient method. This active loading method achieves high encap- sulation ef\ufb01ciency and stable drug retention within the liposomes", "[22]. To improve the circulation time of LD in the bloodstream, the surface of the liposomes is modi\ufb01ed with polyethylene glycol (PEG). This process, known as pegylation, helps the liposomes evade the immune system and reduces clearance by the mononu- clear phagocyte system (MPS) [41]. Drug Delivery in Rare Diseases: Orphan Drugs and Therapies 417 3.10 Marqibo (Vincristine Sulfate) This liposomal formulation of vincristine sulfate is used to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). It uses sphingomyelin/cho- lesterol liposomes to encapsulate vincristine. The drug is loaded into liposomes via active gradient loading. It enhances the pharma- cokinetics and reduces toxicity compared to conventional vincristine [57]. 3.11 DepoCyt (Cytarabine) DepoCyt is a liposomal formulation of cytarabine, used for the treatment of lymphomatous meningitis. DepoCyt utilizes multi- lamellar liposomes to encapsulate cytarabine. The liposomes are prepared by reverse-phase evaporation method, followed by extru- sion to control the size. This formulation allows for sustained release of cytarabine into the cerebrospinal \ufb02uid [58]. 4 Poly(Lactic-co-Glycolic Acid, PLGA) Nanoparticles Makadia and Siegel [59] reviewed the use of PLGA-based nano- particles for controlled drug delivery. These nanoparticles degrade slowly, providing a sustained release of the encapsulated drug. This approach has been utilized in the delivery of various therapeutics, including those for rare diseases, due to PLGA\u2019s biocompatibility and FDA approval [59]. PLGA is a copolymer of lactic acid and glycolic acid. It degrades into lactic acid and glycolic acid, which are metabolized by the body, making PLGA suitable for biomedical applications [60]. One of the most common methods for preparing PLGA nanoparticles is the emulsi", " of lactic acid and glycolic acid. It degrades into lactic acid and glycolic acid, which are metabolized by the body, making PLGA suitable for biomedical applications [60]. One of the most common methods for preparing PLGA nanoparticles is the emulsion solvent evaporation technique (Fig. 2). This involves dissolving PLGA and the drug in an organic solvent (e.g., dichloromethane), forming an emulsion with an aqueous phase containing a surfactant (e.g., polyvinyl alcohol, PVA), and then evaporating the solvent to form nanoparticles [61]. Another method is nanoprecipitation, where PLGA is dissolved in a water-miscible organic solvent (e.g., acetone) and then added to an aqueous phase, leading to the formation of nanoparticles as the solvent diffuses and evaporates [62]. Encapsulation ef\ufb01ciency depends on factors such as the polymer-to-drug ratio, the type of solvent, and the method used. High encapsulation ef\ufb01ciency can be achieved by optimizing these parameters [63]. The surface of PLGA nanoparticles can be modi\ufb01ed with targeting ligands (e.g., antibodies, peptides) to enhance speci\ufb01city. PEGylation (attach- ment of polyethylene glycol) is also used to improve circulation time and reduce immune recognition [64].", "418 Anil Kumar et al. Fig. 2 Preparations of polycaprolactone-based nanoparticles PLGA nanoparticles are generally stable in aqueous suspension but can aggregate over time. To enhance stability, nanoparticles are often lyophilized with cryoprotectants like trehalose or sucrose [59]. While PLGA nanoparticles are less pH-sensitive compared to chitosan nanoparticles, the degradation rate of PLGA can be in\ufb02uenced by pH. Typically, neutral pH conditions are used for storage to minimize hydrolytic degradation [60] (Table 3). 4.1 Drug Release Pro\ufb01le PLGA nanoparticles provide controlled and sustained release of encapsulated drugs. The release pro\ufb01le can be tailored by adjusting the polymer composition (ratio of lactic acid to glycolic acid), molecular weight, and the presence of any surface modi\ufb01cations [63]. The release mechanism generally involves an initial burst release followed by a sustained release phase. This can be modu- lated by altering the preparation conditions and particle size [61]. PLGA is FDA-approved for use in various biomedical applications.", "Drug Delivery in Rare Diseases: Orphan Drugs and Therapies 419 Table 3 Drugs carried by poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid, PLGA) nanoparticles Drug Delivery Disease Preparation method Docetaxel Enhanced solubility and tumor targeting Non-small cell lung cancer Single emulsion solvent evaporation Paclitaxel Improved therapeutic index and reduced side effects Ovarian cancer Nanoprecipitation Curcumin Enhanced bioavailability and targeted delivery In\ufb02ammatory bowel disease Double emulsion solvent evaporation Rifampicin Sustained release for tuberculosis treatment Tuberculosis Spray drying Acyclovir Topical delivery for antiviral treatment Herpes simplex virus infection Emulsion-solvent evaporation siRNA (small interfering RNA) Gene silencing for speci\ufb01c targets Cancer Electrospraying Insulin Controlled release for diabetes management Type 1 diabetes Solvent displacement Donepezil Improved delivery for Alzheimer\u2019s disease Alzheimer\u2019s disease Nanoprecipitation- ultrasonication 4.2 Methods 4.2.1 Reagents 1.

Sonicate the emulsion using an ultrasonicator for 2\u20135 min to reduce the size of the droplets and achieve a uniform distribu- tion of nanoparticles. 5. Transfer the emulsion to a rotary evaporator and evaporate the solvent under reduced pressure at room temperature until the nanoparticles are formed. This step ensures the removal of the organic solvent, leaving behind PLGA nanoparticles suspended in the aqueous phase. 6.

PCL\u2019s slow degradation rate makes it suitable for long-term drug release applications, which is bene\ufb01cial in treating chronic conditions associated with rare dis- eases [65]. PCL nanoparticles can be prepared using several tech- niques, with nanoprecipitation and emulsi\ufb01cation-solvent evaporation being the most common. This method involves dissol- ving PCL in a water-miscible organic solvent such as acetone. The organic solution is then added drop by drop to an aqueous phase containing a stabilizer like polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) under constant stirring. The rapid diffusion of the organic solvent into the aqueous phase leads to the formation of PCL nanoparticles [66]. In another method, PCL is dissolved in a volatile organic solvent (e.g., dichlor- omethane", "inyl alcohol (PVA) under constant stirring. The rapid diffusion of the organic solvent into the aqueous phase leads to the formation of PCL nanoparticles [66]. In another method, PCL is dissolved in a volatile organic solvent (e.g., dichlor- omethane) and then emulsi\ufb01ed in an aqueous phase containing a surfactant like PVA. The organic solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure or ambient conditions, resulting in the formation of PCL nanoparticles. This method is particularly useful for the encapsulation of hydrophobic drugs [67]. 5.1 Surface Modi\ufb01cation Surface modi\ufb01cation of PCL nanoparticles is crucial for improving their biocompatibility, targeting capability, and circulation time. Common techniques include polyethylene glycol coating, which enhances the hydrophilicity of nanoparticles and reduces opsoniza- tion, thus prolonging their circulation time in the bloodstream [68]. Ligand conjugation with speci\ufb01c antibodies or peptides improves the ef\ufb01ciency of drug delivery [69].", "Drug Delivery in Rare Diseases: Orphan Drugs and Therapies 421 5.2 pH Sensitivity and Stability PCL nanoparticles exhibit pH sensitivity, which can be exploited for controlled drug release. The stability of PCL nanoparticles is in\ufb02uenced by the pH of the environment. In acidic conditions, the degradation of PCL is accelerated, leading to a faster release of the encapsulated drugs. This property is advantageous for targeting acidic environments such as tumor tissues or intracellular compart- ments [70]. At neutral or basic pH, PCL nanoparticles are more stable and degrade slowly, providing a sustained release of the drug [65]. The preparation of PCL nanoparticles is generally performed at neutral pH to ensure stability and effective encapsulation. Main- taining a neutral pH during preparation ensures the stability of both the polymer and the drug, leading to uniform nanoparticle formation and high encapsulation ef\ufb01ciency [71]. 5.3 Methods 5.3.1 Materials 1. \u03b5-Caprolactone 2.

Mix the solution thoroughly to achieve uniform drug distribution. 6 Chitosan-Based Systems Chitosan is derived from chitin, a natural polysaccharide found in the exoskeletons of crustaceans and insects, as well as in the cell walls of fungi [72, 73]. Due to its biocompatibility, biodegradabil- ity, and non-toxicity, it is widely used in various biomedical applica- tions, including drug delivery systems, wound dressings, and tissue engineering [74, 75]. When used as a hydrogel, chitosan can form a network that absorbs and retains signi\ufb01cant amounts of water, making it suitable for applications requiring moisture retention and controlled release of substances [76, 77]. Chitosan-based nanoparticles have been used for the delivery of nucleic acids and proteins ", "sorbs and retains signi\ufb01cant amounts of water, making it suitable for applications requiring moisture retention and controlled release of substances [76, 77]. Chitosan-based nanoparticles have been used for the delivery of nucleic acids and proteins in treating genetic and metabolic disorders [78]. One of the most common methods for preparing chitosan nanoparticles is ionic gelation, involving the interaction between positively charged chitosan and a negatively charged polyanion like sodium tripoly- phosphate (TPP) [78].", "Drug Delivery in Rare Diseases: Orphan Drugs and Therapies 423 6.1 Encapsulation of Nucleic Acids and Proteins Chitosan can form complexes with nucleic acids due to its positive charge, which facilitates binding to the negatively charged nucleic acids. This electrostatic interaction helps in the ef\ufb01cient encapsula- tion and protection of nucleic acids [79]. Proteins can be encapsulated within chitosan nanoparticles through adsorption, covalent bonding, or entrapment during the nanoparticle forma- tion process. The mild conditions used in the preparation process help maintain the structural integrity and activity of the proteins [80]. 6.2 Surface Modi\ufb01cation The surface of chitosan nanoparticles can be modi\ufb01ed with target- ing ligands such as folic acid, antibodies, or peptides to enhance the speci\ufb01city of drug delivery to target cells or tissues [81]. Similar to liposomal formulations, chitosan nanoparticles can be pegylated to improve their circulation time and reduce immune recognition [82]. 6.3 pH Sensitivity and Stability of Chitosan Nanoparticles Chitosan-based nanoparticles are highly sensitive to pH changes, which can signi\ufb01cantly impact their stability, encapsulation ef\ufb01- ciency, and drug release pro\ufb01les. Chitosan is a weak base with a pKa value around 6.5, which means it is more soluble in acidic conditions where it is protonated. The preparation of chitosan nanoparticles typically occurs at a pH range of 4.0\u20135.5 to ensure that chitosan remains in a dissolved and protonated state, facilitat- ing ef\ufb01cient nanoparticle formation through ionic gelation [78, 83]. These nanoparticles are often maintained at a slightly acidic pH, usually around 5.0\u20136.0, to maintain their protonation and prevent aggregation, ensuring stability over time [84]. 6.4 Methodology 6.4.1 Rea", "e formation through ionic gelation [78, 83].

Centrifuge 9. pH meter 10. Dialysis membrane 11. Lyophilizer", "424 Anil Kumar et al. 6.4.2 Procedure The entire procedure of chitosan nanoparticles is summarized as follows (Fig. 3): 1. Dissolve chitosan in 1% (v/v) acetic acid solution to obtain a 1\u20132 mg/mL chitosan solution [85]. 2. Stir the solution overnight at room temperature using a mag- netic stirrer until the chitosan is completely dissolved. 3. Prepare a TPP solution in deionized water at a concentration of 1 mg/mL [86]. 4. Dissolve the drug in the chitosan solution under magnetic stirring. The concentration of the drug depends on the desired drug loading ef\ufb01ciency [87]. 5. Add the TPP solution drop by drop to the chitosan-drug solu- tion under continuous stirring. The typical chitosan to TPP weight ratio ranges from 3:1 to 5:1 [88]. This leads to the ionic gelation of chitosan and the formation of nanoparticles. 6. Sonicate the mixture using an ultrasonicator for 5\u201310 min to reduce the size of the nanoparticles and achieve a uniform distribution [89]. 7. Adjust the pH of the nanoparticle suspension to 5.5 using 1 M NaOH or HCl, as chitosan nanoparticles are more stable at this pH [90]. 8. Centrifuge the suspension at 10,000 rpm for 20 min to sepa- rate the nanoparticles. Wash the pellet with deionized water to remove excess TPP and unencapsulated drug [91]. 9. Dialyze the nanoparticle suspension against deionized water for 24 h using a dialysis membrane to remove residual acetic acid and other small molecules [92]. 10. Freeze-dry the puri\ufb01ed nanoparticle suspension to obtain a dry nanoparticle powder. Store the powder at -20 \u00b0C for future use [93]. 7 Dendrimers Dendrimers are highly branched, synthetic macromolecules with a tree-like structure, known for their unique and intricate architec- ture.

These macromolecules are synthesized through a controlled step-by-step process, resulting in a symmetrical and highly branched structure that resembles a tree with multiple branches extending from a central core [94, 95]. For instance, polyamidoa- mine (PAMAM) dendrimers are synthesized starting from an ethy- lenediamine core, with each generation involving the addition of methacrylate units, resulting in a highly branched architecture [96]. The branching occurs in layers, or generations, where each successive generation adds new branches, increasing the overall size and complexity of the dendrimer [96].", "Drug Delivery in Rare Diseases: Orphan Drugs and Therapies 425 Fig. 4 Dendrimer PAMAM dendrimers can be synthesized up to the tenth gener- ation, with each generation doubling the number of terminal groups and signi\ufb01cantly increasing the molecular weight and size [97]. Their well-de\ufb01ned three-dimensional structure provides numerous advantages for drug delivery purposes. The highly branched architecture creates internal cavities within the dendri- mer, which can encapsulate a variety of guest molecules, including drugs, within these cavities (Fig. 4) [98, 99]. This encapsulation capability is particularly bene\ufb01cial for enhancing the solubility and stability of hydrophobic drugs, which are often challenging to deliver effectively in their native form [100] (Table 4). Dendrimers can also be functionalized with targeting ligands, such as antibodies or peptides, allowing for targeted delivery and controlled release of therapeutic agents [101, 102]. For instance,", "dendrimers functionalized with folic acid have been used to target cancer cells overexpressing folate receptors, thereby increasing the speci\ufb01city of drug delivery [103]. The surface of dendrimers can also be modi\ufb01ed to release their payload in response to speci\ufb01c stimuli, such as pH changes, temperature variations, or enzymatic activity [96]. This controlled release mechanism ensures that the drug is released at the desired site of action and at the optimal therapeutic concentration. For example, dendrimers designed to degrade in acidic environments can release their payload in the acidic tumor microenvironment, enhancing the targeted delivery of anticancer drugs [98]. 426 Anil Kumar et al.

For instance, they hav", "drimers have been explored for a range of other biomedical applications. Their ability to form stable complexes with nucleic acids, such as DNA and RNA, makes them promising candidates for gene delivery and gene ther- apy [97]. For instance, they have been used to deliver small inter- fering RNA (siRNA) for the treatment of genetic disorders, improving the stability and cellular uptake of siRNA molecules [104]. 7.1 Antisense Oligonucleotides Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are short, synthetic strands of DNA or RNA that can bind to speci\ufb01c mRNA molecules, blocking their ability to produce proteins. This mechanism makes ASOs effective in treating genetic disorders by silencing disease-causing genes. Dendrimer nanoparticles have been employed to deliver", "ASOs for conditions such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a severe muscle-wasting disease [105, 106]. They enhance the delivery of ASOs by improving their stability and cellular uptake. For example, PAMAM dendrimers conjugated with ASOs targeting dystrophin mRNA have shown increased ef\ufb01ciency in muscle cells, offering potential therapeutic bene\ufb01ts for DMD patients [107, 108]. The ability to modify the surface of dendrimers with targeting ligands allows for speci\ufb01c delivery to muscle tissues, reducing off-target effects and enhancing therapeutic outcomes [98]. Drug Delivery in Rare Diseases: Orphan Drugs and Therapies 427 7.2 Small-Interfering RNA (siRNA) They are ideal carriers for siRNA due to their ability to form stable complexes with these nucleic acids, protecting them from degrada- tion and facilitating cellular uptake. For instance, dendrimer-based siRNA delivery systems have been developed to target and silence the transthyretin gene, demonstrating signi\ufb01cant gene silencing and therapeutic effects in preclinical models [100, 104]. The sur- face functionalization of dendrimers with polyethylene glycol (PEG) or other stabilizing agents further enhances the biocompat- ibility and circulation time of siRNA, improving its therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy [109]. Dendrimer-based delivery systems have been extensively investi- gated for the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents, particularly for treating rare cancers such as glioblastoma. Glioblastoma is an aggressive brain tumor with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. The unique structure of dendrimers allows for the encap- sulation and targeted delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs, improv- ing their solubility, stability, and therapeutic index [110, 111]. For example, dendrimers have been used to deliver drugs like dox", "unique structure of dendrimers allows for the encap- sulation and targeted delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs, improv- ing their solubility, stability, and therapeutic index [110, 111]. For example, dendrimers have been used to deliver drugs like doxoru- bicin and paclitaxel to glioblastoma cells. These dendrimer-drug complexes can cross the blood-brain barrier and release the drug directly at the tumor site, enhancing its cytotoxic effects on cancer cells while minimizing damage to healthy tissues [97, 112]. Further- more, the surface modi\ufb01cation of dendrimers with targeting ligands, such as transferrin or folic acid, facilitates the selective targeting of glioblastoma cells, increasing the speci\ufb01city and ef\ufb01cacy of the treatment [113, 114]. 7.3 Chemo- therapeutic Agents 7.4 Methods of Preparation of Dendrimer-Based Nanoparticles Two methods are used to prepare dendrimer based nanoparticles. 7.4.1 Divergent Method The divergent method, also known as the \u201ccore-outward\u201d method, begins with a core molecule and builds outward in a stepwise fashion [95, 115]. Start with a multifunctional core molecule,", "such as ethylenediamine for polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendri- mers [116, 117]. Dissolve the core molecule in a suitable solvent, such as methanol or dimethyl sulfoxide [117, 118]. Add an excess of acrylate or amine-based monomers, such as methyl acrylate for PAMAM dendrimers [100, 119]. Stir the reaction mixture at room temperature or slightly elevated temperatures, typically between 25 and 50 \u00b0C, for a speci\ufb01c period, usually 24\u201348 h, to ensure complete reaction [104, 116]. Purify the resulting product using techniques such as precipitation, dialysis, or ultra\ufb01ltration to remove unreacted monomers and by-products [98, 118]. 428 Anil Kumar et al. To synthesize the second generation (G2), activate the terminal groups of the \ufb01rst-generation dendrimer by adding a cross-linking agent such as ethylenediamine [112, 119]. Repeat the monomer addition step using the same or different monomers to form the second-generation dendrimer [97, 114]. Maintain similar reaction conditions as for the \ufb01rst generation, then purify the second- generation dendrimer to remove unreacted reagents and by-products [113, 115]. Continue this process for subsequent generations, repeating the monomer addition, activation, and puri- \ufb01cation steps for each successive generation until the desired gen- eration, such as G5 or G10, is achieved [95, 116]. Optimize reaction times, temperatures, and puri\ufb01cation methods to ensure high purity and yield at each generation [104, 116]. Finally, conduct a thorough puri\ufb01cation of the \ufb01nal dendrimer product using advanced techniques such as high-performance liq- uid chromatography (HPLC) or size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) [98, 118]. Characterize the \ufb01nal dendrimer using spectro- scopic methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS), along ", "niques such as high-performance liq- uid chromatography (HPLC) or size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) [98, 118]. Characterize the \ufb01nal dendrimer using spectro- scopic methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS), along with chromatographic techniques, to con\ufb01rm its structure, molecular weight, and purity [111, 112]. 7.4.2 Convergent Method This method, also known as the \u201coutside-inward\u201d method, starts with the synthesis of dendritic branches, which are then attached to a core molecule [115, 116]. Select suitable monomers for the dendritic branches, such as amine-based monomers [100, 104]. Begin by synthesizing the outermost layer of the dendrimer, typically the third or fourth generation [118, 120]. Dis- solve the monomers in a suitable solvent, such as methanol or DMSO, and carry out the polymerization reaction at controlled temperatures, generally between 25 and 50 \u00b0C, with continuous stirring [114, 117]. Purify the resulting branched structure using precipitation, dialysis, or ultra\ufb01ltration to remove unreacted mono- mers and by-products [113, 119]. Next, activate the terminal groups of the outer branches and couple them with intermediate-generation branches [114, 118]. Maintain the reaction mixture at appropriate tempera- tures, typically 25\u201350 \u00b0C, with continuous stirring [98, 112]. Purify", "the intermediate branches to ensure high purity and yield [111, 115]. Choose a multifunctional core molecule, such as ethy- lenediamine, and couple the intermediate branches to the core molecule [100, 104]. Dissolve the core molecule and intermediate branches in a suitable solvent, such as methanol or DMSO, and stir the reaction mixture at controlled temperatures, usually between 25 and 50 \u00b0C, for a speci\ufb01c period, generally 24\u201348 hours [116, 118]. Purify the resulting dendrimer using advanced techni- ques such as HPLC or SEC to remove unreacted reagents and by-products [114, 117]. Drug Delivery in Rare Diseases: Orphan Drugs and Therapies 429 8 Challenges in Developing Orphan Drugs The development of orphan drugs faces numerous challenges, primarily due to the unique nature of rare diseases and the eco- nomic considerations involved (Table 5). One of the most signi\ufb01- cant challenges is the high cost of research and development. Developing a new drug is an expensive and lengthy process, often exceeding a decade and costing hundreds of millions of dollars [121]. For orphan drugs, the limited patient population means that the potential market is much smaller, making it dif\ufb01cult for pharmaceutical companies to recoup their investments [122]. Table 5 Challenges in developing orphan drugs Challenge Description Small patient population Limits clinical trial size, ef\ufb01cacy evaluation, and recruitment High development costs R&D expenses may not be recouped with a small patient pool Dif\ufb01culty in diagnosis Delays identi\ufb01cation of patients and hinders trial enrolment Regulatory uncertainty Evolving regulations and unclear pathways for orphan drug approval Lack of expertise Limited research on rare diseases and a shortage of specialists Manufacturing challenges Dif\ufb01culties in produc", "nts and hinders trial enrolment Regulatory uncertainty Evolving regulations and unclear pathways for orphan drug approval Lack of expertise Limited research on rare diseases and a shortage of specialists Manufacturing challenges Dif\ufb01culties in producing drugs for small patient populations Reimbursement issues Securing insurance coverage for high-cost orphan drugs Intellectual property challenges Balancing innovation incentives with patient access Ethical concerns Protecting vulnerable populations during clinical trials Placebo selection Dif\ufb01culty \ufb01nding appropriate placebos for rare disease trials Natural history variability Understanding the disease course in a limited patient pool Biomarker development Identifying reliable measures for disease progression and treatment response", "430 Anil Kumar et al. Clinical trials for orphan drugs present speci\ufb01c dif\ufb01culties. Recruiting enough participants for statistically signi\ufb01cant results is challenging due to the small number of patients affected by any given rare disease [123]. Patients are often geographically dis- persed, increasing the complexity and cost of conducting multicen- ter trials [124]. Regulatory requirements, while providing essential safety and ef\ufb01cacy standards, can also add layers of complexity and cost to the drug development process [125]. The heterogeneity of rare diseases further complicates orphan drug development. Many rare diseases are genetically diverse, meaning that treatments effec- tive for some patients may not work for others with different genetic mutations [126]. This variability necessitates personalized approaches and can require the development of multiple drugs or targeted therapies for a single disease, further increasing develop- ment costs and times [1]. Financial incentives provided by governments, such as tax cred- its, grant funding, and market exclusivity, are crucial to encourag- ing the development of orphan drugs [127]. However, these incentives may not fully offset the \ufb01nancial risks and high costs involved, particularly for smaller biotechnology \ufb01rms with limited resources [128]. Furthermore, the high price of orphan drugs, necessary to ensure return on investment, often leads to issues with reimbursement and access, as healthcare systems may struggle to afford these expensive treatments [129]. Another challenge is the need for greater understanding and awareness of rare diseases among healthcare providers and the general public. Many rare diseases are underdiagnosed or misdiag- nosed, delaying appropriate treatment and complicating the recruitment of pa", "nge is the need for greater understanding and awareness of rare diseases among healthcare providers and the general public. Many rare diseases are underdiagnosed or misdiag- nosed, delaying appropriate treatment and complicating the recruitment of patients for clinical trials [130]. Increased education and awareness are essential to improve diagnosis rates and patient outcomes, but achieving this requires substantial investment in outreach and education efforts [131]. Despite these challenges, ongoing advancements in medical research and technology offer hope for the future of orphan drug development. Innovations in genomics and personalized medicine, along with improved regulatory pathways, may help overcome some of the existing barriers [132]. Collaborative efforts among governments, industry, academia, and patient advocacy groups are also crucial to address the multifaceted challenges and to ensure the continued development and availability of orphan drugs for patients in need [133].

The entire therapy process may be pointless in the absence of an effective delivery of the system. The drug must also be delivered at a precise target spot at a predetermined controlled pattern to achieve optimal ef\ufb01cacy and safety. Many aspects of therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy, like pharmacokinetics, distribution, absorption into cells and metabo- lism, excretion and clearance, and toxicity, are impacted by the route of delivery. Both innovative delivery systems and a greater understanding of the basic principles underlying how drug distribution in\ufb02uences safety and ef\ufb01cacy are required as the biotechnology sector develops novel kinds of biopharmaceuticals. Drug resistance is still an ongoing issue though, mostly owing to our incomplete knowledge of the biological barriers that prevent many drugs from reaching their intended targets. Despite the signi\ufb01cant advantages of immunotherapy, off-target effects continue to cause serious adverse immune reactions. Recently, the research and development of drug delivery systems (DDS) have gained increased attention. Over decades of innovation, DDS has proven effective in delivering drugs with precision, thereby reducing side effects. They also offer bene\ufb01ts such as \ufb02exible control over drug release, improved pharmacokinetics, and enhanced drug distribution. Therefore, in this book chapter, a detailed overview of combining the approach of immunotherapies and vaccines with drug delivery systems is discusse", "uch as \ufb02exible control over drug release, improved pharmacokinetics, and enhanced drug distribution. Therefore, in this book chapter, a detailed overview of combining the approach of immunotherapies and vaccines with drug delivery systems is discussed to improve the thera- peutic effect. Key words Drug delivery systems (DDS), Bioavailability, Controlled release, Pharmacokinetics, Immunotherapy 1 Introduction For more than 60 years, engineers, chemists, physicists, biologists, and physicians have worked together to develop biomaterials for use in innovative drug delivery systems. The delivery and effective- ness of many drugs, such as antibodies, peptides, vaccines, medica- tions, and enzymes, have been enhanced by biomaterials. Drugs can be released from biomaterials for extended periods and at speci\ufb01ed sites. Silicone rubber was the \ufb01rst biomaterial for Abhishek Pathak and Satya Pal Singh (eds.), Next-Generation Drug Delivery Systems, Methods in Pharmacology and Toxicology, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-4554-3_19, \u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025 437", "controlled drug release to be documented. It is used to deliver a variety of medications, such as steroids, atropine, histamine, anes- thetics, antimalarials, and anti-schistosomal medicines [11]. 438 Santanu Pal et al. Fig. 1 A simpli\ufb01ed diagram showing the interconnections between the immunological responses by drug delivery systems along with the dashed arrows indicating potential, uncon\ufb01rmed routes for platelet activation. (Created by using BIORENDER) Systems for targeted delivery of drugs show promise in deliver- ing active ingredients to speci\ufb01c tissues or cell populations. As a result, drug concentrations that are elevated locally can be achieved, leading to increased ef\ufb01cacy. Because innocent bystander cells are less impacted, the negative consequences should be reduced. Tar- geting certain cell subsets or tissues has the potential to signi\ufb01cantly improve treatments. Targeting APCs is particularly interesting for therapeutically modulating immune responses (Fig. 1). APCs are made up of tissue-resident macrophage subsets, circulating mono- cytes, and recirculating and tissue-resident dendritic cell subsets. The most straightforward method of targeting a particular APC subgroup would be to coat nanocarriers with antibodies that bind cell type-speci\ufb01c surface receptors. Heat-shock proteins are the basis of another APC-targeting strategy [33]. This method results in antigen-speci\ufb01c T-cell priming and peptide presentation that is major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted. Further, anti- TLR antibody-decorated nanocarriers are capable of selectively targeting individual APC subsets. In this manner, it has been demonstrated that TLR-directed targeting can transport antigenic", "carriers are capable of selectively targeting individual APC subsets. In this manner, it has been demonstrated that TLR-directed targeting can transport antigenic", "peptides to MHC molecules through endosomes, where they are then exposed to trigger T-cell responses speci\ufb01c to the antigen [48]. Drug Delivery to the Immune System: Immunotherapies and Vaccines 439 Further, methods including transdermal patches and other externally applied non-invasive controlled-release delivery methods have made it easier to provide analgesics and smoking cessation medications over the long term [42]. Recently, it was found that live-cell therapies govern or facilitate important biological pro- cesses by utilizing the inherent therapeutic properties of certain cell types. Overall, it appears that changes in drug delivery systems, drug modi\ufb01cations, and microenvironment modi\ufb01cations play key roles in drug delivery to the immune system. 2 Vaccine Delivery Systems New vaccines are needed due to safety concerns, weak immune responses, and poor patient compliance. The drug delivery systems aim to incorporate antigen doses to eliminate the need for booster shots by releasing antigens gradually and under control (Fig. 2). It also aims to regulate the timing and location of antigen presenta- tion to direct them ef\ufb01ciently to immune cells. Oil-based adjuvants such as Freund\u2019s adjuvant decrease the required vaccine doses but pose toxicity risks such as granuloma formation. As a result, they are not widely used. FDA-approved adjuvants, aluminum hydroxide, Fig. 2 Various available novel and conventional vaccine delivery systems. (Created by using BIORENDER)", "and aluminum phosphate (alum) are safer options [47]. Conse- quently, efforts have focused on developing particulate delivery systems for antigens, aiming to enhance safety and ef\ufb01cacy. 440 Santanu Pal et al. 3 Polymers Biodegradable PLGA polymers are now used for matrix antigen delivery, rapidly absorbed by M-cells, and transported to lymphatic tissue within an hour [15]. Inhalable PLGA microspheres loaded with TB antigens were devised for treating pulmonary tuberculosis. The particles, sized at 3.3 \u03bcm, were suitable for inhalation. These microspheres released antigens gradually over 10 days, showing a stronger immune response than antigen solutions in T-lymphocyte assays [53]. However, PLGA\u2019s ef\ufb01cacy is hindered by acid degrada- tion products harming the entrapped protein and loss of immuno- genicity during storage. Also, organic solvents used for antigen loading on the polymer can damage the antigen [47]. Polypho- sphazenes are a type of polymer with a simple backbone -P = N- in\ufb02uenced by side chain attachments and can encapsulate antigens in water at lower temperatures. Adding crosslinking agents like calcium makes the system insoluble, enabling sustained release. Coating the solid with polylysine further controls release. This method is used for antibacterial drug release in controlled-release strings made from calcium alginate, speci\ufb01cally designed for place- ment in dental periodontal cavities [15]. Chitosan, a safer polysac- charide derived from chitin, an alternative to PLGA, binds to immunogenic DNA without the need for organic solvents [27]. Dendrimers and cyclodextrins are the new classes of materials that are exploited for vaccine delivery. Due to the surface charge and size of the dendrimers, they are extremely biocompatible and exhibit biodistribution and", "d for organic solvents [27]. Dendrimers and cyclodextrins are the new classes of materials that are exploited for vaccine delivery. Due to the surface charge and size of the dendrimers, they are extremely biocompatible and exhibit biodistribution and cell membrane interacting properties. These characteristics can increase the ef\ufb01ciency of vaccines, making them an ef\ufb01cient immunostimulating adjuvant. G2 dendrimer is a nonlinear, globular dendrimer that is composed of polyethylene glycol 600 (PEG-600) and citric acid. It was evaluated for adjuvan- ticity after administration with the rabies virus inactivated vaccine in a mice model, and the result showed that there was an enhanced immune response with high neutralizing antibodies against rabies virus. 4 Non-biodegradable NPs Non-biodegradable materials like carbon, gold, silica, polystyrene, and quantum dots have been exploited to be used as adjuvants and delivery systems. They present the antigen to tissues with increased immunogenicity by remaining in the tissues for a long period.", "Though they induce high cellular and humoral immune responses by binding with different functional groups and antigens, valida- tion of safety is important as they aggregate in tissues leading to toxicity. Gold nanoparticles prove to be ef\ufb01cient adjuvants and have been used for in vivo delivery of plasmid DNA for HIV treatment. Recombinant trimetric in\ufb02uenza hemagglutinin conjugated on gold nanoparticles that are coupled with TLR-5 agonist \ufb02agellin is used as a particulate adjuvant system. Increased production of in\ufb02uenza-speci\ufb01c IgA and IgG levels is observed in mice after intranasal vaccination. A negatively charged carbon nanoparticle, OCN (oxidized carbon nanosphere) was prepared and studied for antigen uptake in vitro and generation of immune response in vivo. Improved cell-mediated immune response with elevated antigen- speci\ufb01c CD8+ T cells was observed when BALB/c mice were immunized with OCN subcutaneously. The use of quantum dots (QDs) as \ufb02uorescent nanoparticles is widely explored for in vitro and in vivo imaging of dendritic cells. Drug Delivery to the Immune System: Immunotherapies and Vaccines 441 5 Calcium Phosphate NPs For 30 years, calcium phosphate has been used to deliver genetic material to mammalian cells. It is a readily absorbed, naturally occurring body constituent with good biocompatibility, resulting in fewer safety-related issues. In France, the DTP (diphtheria-teta- nus-pertussis) vaccine was used as an adjuvant until 1980 in the form of calcium phosphate gel or suspension. Functionalized cal- cium phosphate nanoparticles of 100\u2013400 nm size can induce both innate and adaptive immune response by activating dendritic cells, as shown in various preclinical studies. CPNPs are shown to have a greater immunostimulatory effect compared to commonly us", " phosphate nanoparticles of 100\u2013400 nm size can induce both innate and adaptive immune response by activating dendritic cells, as shown in various preclinical studies. CPNPs are shown to have a greater immunostimulatory effect compared to commonly used aluminum (alum) adjuvants for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and HSV-2. CPNPs prove to be a promising alternative to aluminum adjuvants for many vaccines. The micrometer-sized CPNP aggre- gates, in vivo in BALB/c mice, showed a high titer of neutralizing antibodies, demonstrating high protection against HSV-type 2 that are more potent than aluminum adjuvant. 6 Colloidally Stable Nanoparticles Various carbohydrates like dextran, mannose, and pullulan cannot self-associate in an aqueous solution because of their water solubi- lity. However, they become amphiphilic when conjugated to hydro- phobic materials like cholesterol. These molecules when self- assembled with or without proteins form colloidally stable nano- particles with sizes ranging from 30 to 40 nm. The degree of", "substitution of hydrophobic groups controls the size, density, and colloidal stability of the nanoparticles. 442 Santanu Pal et al. A water-soluble, linear polysaccharide that has \u03b1-1,6-linked maltotriose residue is the pullulan that is most used. It has increased shelf-life and stability due to oxygen barrier properties, and the \ufb01lm-forming property of pullulan makes it easy to entrap biological molecules. The mechanism of innate immunity depends on the binding of polysaccharides to mannose-binding lectins and other C-type lectins of the mannose receptor family on macrophages and DCs. Cholesteryl pullulan nanoparticles are prepared by encapsu- lating TNF-\u03b1 for nasal delivery of the H1N1 in\ufb02uenza vaccine. 7 Proteasomes Proteasomes are complex proteolytic structures found in eukaryotic cells that play a crucial role in degrading misfolded, damaged, or unnecessary proteins. Recently, proteasomes have gained attention as a novel drug delivery system due to their ability to regulate protein homeostasis and their involvement in various cellular pro- cesses. Leveraging proteasomes for drug delivery offers several potential advantages, particularly for targeting intracellular path- ways. Since 1981, OMPs have been used in the meningococcal vaccine. To deliver apolar or amphiphilic antigens, hydrophobic OMP is a promising system as noncovalent interaction between the proteasome and antigen leads to the formation of complexes [40]. Proteasomes are regarded as safe after various human clinical trials. An intranasal in\ufb02uenza vaccine (FluINsure) that contains inactivated antigens and a proteasome adjuvant is considered safe and known to induce both cellular and humoral immune responses. A quadrivalent conjugate vaccine for Meningococcus conjugated to diphtheria toxoid is available ", "luINsure) that contains inactivated antigens and a proteasome adjuvant is considered safe and known to induce both cellular and humoral immune responses. A quadrivalent conjugate vaccine for Meningococcus conjugated to diphtheria toxoid is available in the market as Menactra\u00ae (Sano\ufb01). Proteasomes-adjuvanted trivalent inactivated vaccine for in\ufb02uenza was found to be safe after the Phase I and Phase II clinical studies, which are administered intranasally. 8 Liposomes Liposomes, composed of a phospholipid bilayer, serve as vehicles for immunomodulatory agents, encapsulating both hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds. Having a phospholipid bilayer that is 4\u20135 nm thick, the size of liposomes is between 30 nm and the micrometer [30]. Liposomes act as vaccine adjuvants, interacting with cell surface lipid receptors and rapidly integrating into the reticuloendothelial system. Moreover, through passive and/or active targeting, liposomes can transport their payload to the dis- eased site selectively, thus reducing systemic adverse effects,", "increasing the maximum tolerated dose, and enhancing therapeutic bene\ufb01ts [30]. Polymerized liposomes offer enhanced stability, are potentially useful for mucosal vaccination, and can be customized by coating with targeting molecules like antibodies to bind to speci\ufb01c cell receptors. Stealth liposomes, coated with PEG, reduce opsonization by serum proteins and prolong circulation half-lives. Features like lipid composition, size, charge, size distribution, entrapment, and location of antigens or adjuvants can be attained by choosing proper liposome composition and preparation. Based on the chemical properties, water-soluble compounds like proteins, peptides, carbohydrates, haptens, and nucleic acids are trapped within the aqueous space inside in contrast lipophilic compounds like lipopeptides, adjuvants, linker molecules, and antigens are interpolated into the lipid bilayer and attachment of antigens to the liposome surface can be done by either adsorption or stable chemical linking [59]. Drug Delivery to the Immune System: Immunotherapies and Vaccines 443 Encapsulated nucleic acid molecules encoding the basal body rod protein of Campylobacter, within liposomes along with adju- vants, serve multiple purposes, including inducing immunogenicity against Campylobacter, functioning as diagnostic tools, and facil- itating passive immunization [51]. Liposomal vaccines, including one containing oral encapsulated recombinant H. pylori heat shock protein 60 (rHsp60) tested in mice, showed promising immune responses against H. pylori infection [54]. Antigen encapsulation in acid-resistant liposomes resulted in more ef\ufb01cient antigen presenta- tion via MHC-II [17]. Virosome-based liposomal vaccines are approved in Europe for Hepatitis A and In\ufb02uenza. Encapsulating IL-2 in liposomes, ", "fection [54]. Antigen encapsulation in acid-resistant liposomes resulted in more ef\ufb01cient antigen presenta- tion via MHC-II [17]. Virosome-based liposomal vaccines are approved in Europe for Hepatitis A and In\ufb02uenza. Encapsulating IL-2 in liposomes, the medication was able to inhibit tumor growth in a B16.F10 melanoma model when administered intravenously along with irradiated tumor cells. Considering liposomal IL-2 to soluble IL-2, this therapy required fewer administrations and lower cumulative dosages [25]. Niosomes, which are non-ionic surfactant vesicles, are currently utilized as carrier systems for delivering vac- cines. For instance, when ovalbumin was encapsulated into Wasag\u00ae 7 niosomes, there was a notable rise in antibody levels compared to empty niosomes, ovalbumin alone, or a control for- mulation when tested in BALB/c mice [43]. 9 Virus-like Particles (VLPs) and Virosomes Virosomes are small lipid membrane vesicles containing viral mem- brane proteins but no genetic material. A biodegradable, synthetic nano virus strategy is the VLP-based vaccinations. They vary in size from 80 to 150 nm and possess an empty core that is used for carrying antigens or drugs for targeted delivery (Fig. 3). The membrane of VLPs is composed of viral phospholipids and glyco- proteins. These VLP-based vaccines exhibit the property of", "conveying the trapped antigen to both MHC class I (CD8+) and MHC class II (CD4+) antigen-presenting cells and also through receptor-mediated endocytosis. They deliver antigens by directly fusing with the immune cells, triggering a speci\ufb01c immune response, even with weak immunogenic antigens. Viral proteins in the lipid bilayer enhance stability and immunological properties. Physical association between virosomes and antigens is crucial for their adjuvant effect, making them a versatile system for antigen delivery. Virosome formulations elicit immune responses depend- ing on antigen location: surface-exposed virosomes [35] trigger humoral responses via MHC II presentation, while encapsulated antigens induce CD4+ and CD8+ responses along with strong cytotoxic T-cell activity via MHC I pathway. Ease of production and the promising immunological response of VLPs make it a major attractive strategy. To eliminate the virulence on host cells, the genetic code for integrase and viral RNA is removed. VLPs that act against heterologous antigens can also be produced. The most used method to produce VLPs is the baculovirus expression system which has good safety as it cannot infect humans naturally. Yeast cells (Pichia pastoris, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Hansenula poly- morpha) and mammalian cells (Chinese hamster ovary cell line [CHO]) can be used as hosts for expression. The structure and production process of VLPs differ according to the choice of host cell. VLP-based approved vaccines are available against hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HPV. Gardasil is the \ufb01rst VLP-based HPV vaccine that was approved by the FDA in 2006. Registered vaccines for hepatitis A (Epaxal\u00ae ) and in\ufb02uenza (In\ufb02exal\u00ae V) validate virosomes 444 Santanu Pal et al. Fig. 3 A summary of virus-like particles (V", ") and HPV.

Drug Delivery to the Immune System: Immunotherapies and Vaccines 445 10 Immune-Stimulating Complexes ISCOMs ISCOMs, nano-sized complexes formed by mixing saponin, cho- lesterol, phospholipid, and an immunogen-like protein, mimic virus particles and boost the immune system. They provoke broad immune responses, with high antibody levels and strong T cells, including enhanced cytokine secretion and activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Broad isotype pro\ufb01le and high antibody titers are the important characteristic features of the antibody response eluci- dated by the ISCOM-based vaccine. The immune response is attained even with lower doses of antigens [46]. After vaccination with an ISCOM-based vaccine containing the hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein, long-lasting CTL responses were produced in nonhuman primates. One year following the last dosage (the last time point studied), signi\ufb01cant memory responses were seen. Like- wise, extended antibody responses have been noted in primates (Kersten et al., 2004). The capacity to activate adaptive immunity in the presence of pre-existing maternal antibodies is the other important property of the ISCOM-based vaccine. Against the mea- sles virus and equine herpes 2 viruses, active immunity was pro- duced even in the presence of maternal antibodies in non-human primates and equines, respectively, when immunized with an ISCOM-based vaccine whereas conventional killed vaccines cannot produce it. Two registered ISCOM-based veterinary vaccines are available for horses: one is an in\ufb02uenza vaccine, and the other is Equity\u2122, a peptide vaccine used to control e", "zed with an ISCOM-based vaccine whereas conventional killed vaccines cannot produce it. Two registered ISCOM-based veterinary vaccines are available for horses: one is an in\ufb02uenza vaccine, and the other is Equity\u2122, a peptide vaccine used to control estrous behavior in \ufb01llies and mares [46]. ISCOM-based vaccines are also developed for Moraxella, Helicobacter, Campylobacter infections, and equine in\ufb02uenza [10]. 11 Emulsion Delivery Systems Emulsions, which are heterogeneous liquid systems, can be cate- gorized as water-in-oil or oil-in-water types. They can also be more complex, like multiple emulsions or nano-emulsions. Antigens are dissolved in water and emulsi\ufb01ed in oil with an emulsi\ufb01er. Con- trolled release depends on factors such as oil viscosity and droplet size. For instance, high oil may irritate the injection sites, and large droplets reduce shelf life. MF59 is an emulsion-based delivery system (oil-in-water) forming approximately 160 nm-sized dro- plets that are composed of squalene, a naturally occurring sub- stance, and two surfactants (polysorbate 80 and sorbitan trioleate)", "in citrate buffer [40]. An in\ufb02uenza vaccine with squalene (MF59- adjuvanted vaccine) was approved in Italy in 1997 and in other countries in 2000. To enhance the adjuvant activity of muramyl dipeptide (MDP), the chemical structure is modulated still reduc- ing its pyrogenic side effects by using MF59 (oil-in-water emulsion carriers). A safe derivative of MDP is the murabutide (MB), which is a squalene-based emulsion adjuvant that exerts its effect by activating NOD 2 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain- containing protein 2). A novel emulsion vaccine using a bioresorb- able polymer called ovalbumin-PEG-b-PLACL was developed. In vivo studies in mice with ovalbumin-PEG-b-PLACL-based emul- sions demonstrated signi\ufb01cant enhancement in antigen-speci\ufb01c antibody titers, T-cell proliferative responses, and secretion of IFN-gamma [22]. A highly re\ufb01ned emulsi\ufb01er in a natural metabo- lizable oil solution from the mannide monooleate family is the Montanide ISA 50 V, 51, ISA 206, and 720. Out of these, ISA 50 V, 51, and 720 are water-in-oil emulsions, whereas ISA 206 is a double emulsion (water-in-oil-in-water) with sizes ranging from 10 to 500 nm. Despite possessing the property to induce a strong immune response, severe local reactions limited their use. Monta- nides ISA 51 VG and 720 are safe and known to induce CD4 and CD8 immune responses as per clinical studies. Montanide- adjuvanted vaccines (ISA 51) are currently available against diseases like HIV, malaria, and various cancers. 446 Santanu Pal et al. 12 Exosome-Based Vaccine Delivery System Bilayered membrane vesicles created mostly by all cells less than 1 nm cells are extracellular vehicles (EVs). Almost all the secretions of the body like saliva, breast milk, and blood naturally contain EVs. Two primary categories", "ine Delivery System Bilayered membrane vesicles created mostly by all cells less than 1 nm cells are extracellular vehicles (EVs). Almost all the secretions of the body like saliva, breast milk, and blood naturally contain EVs. Two primary categories of EVs are the exosomes and microvesicles based on their biosynthesis (Fig. 4). The movement of phospholi- pids controls the outward budding of the plasma membrane, result- ing in the formation of microvesicles. In the extracellular region, the exosomes can fuse with the recipient plasma membrane, releas- ing the bundled substance into the cytosol. Due to their vascular permeability, biodistribution, solubility, and stability, EVs are regarded as excellent vaccine candidates. Na\u0131\u00a8ve antigen structure is maintained by EVs, and through physiological \ufb02uids, they can gain access to all organs. 13 Immunotherapy Using Nano- and Microparticles Some of the major challenges facing immunotherapy include off-target toxicity and non-speci\ufb01c immune activation. To address this, NPs and MPs can be used as ef\ufb01cient drug delivery systems for", "immunotherapies to help modulate the immune system. Of the common polymeric particles used, most are made from biodegrad- able polyesters, polyketides, chitosan, and modi\ufb01ed dextrans. Many of the biodegradable polyesters (e.g., poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA)) are FDA-approved drug delivery vehicles. Encapsulation of immunostimulatory agents into polymeric particle carriers can improve delivery and control the release of these agents.

(Created by using BIORENDER) 14 Properties and Role of Nanoparticles in Drug Delivery Typically, particles that are less than 200 nm can be endocytosed by both phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells. In addition, polymeric NPs in this size range made from polystyrene, carboxylated poly- styrene, and polypropylene sul\ufb01de have been shown to effectively traverse the interstitial space to drain directly to lymphatic vessels and nodes, where they can be taken up by LN-resident APCs such as plasmacytoid DCs. Particles greater than 200 nm in diameter can be phagocytosed by na\u0131\u00a8ve peripheral APCs, which then migrate to the lymph nodes when activated. Whereas particles that are 1\u20132 \u03bcm are predominately taken up by DCs, 2\u20133 \u03bcm particles are taken up more by macrophages. However, both cell types are capable of engul\ufb01ng particles nearly as large as the size of the cell (~50 \u03bcm), with the primary limitation of phagocytosis being the contact angle rather than the overall volume of the target particle [2]. A particularly useful property for immunotherapy is particles\u2019 ability to elicit cross-presentation of antigens, whereby particle- associated exogenous antigens enter the cytosol of APCs and are proce", "an the overall volume of the target particle [2]. A particularly useful property for immunotherapy is particles\u2019 ability to elicit cross-presentation of antigens, whereby particle- associated exogenous antigens enter the cytosol of APCs and are processed for presentation onto MHC-I to stimulate antigen- speci\ufb01c CTL responses and subsequent killing of antigen-", "expressing tumor cells [9]. The outcomes of various adjuvant and antigen release kinetics from APC-internalized microparticles using the conveniently modi\ufb01able degradation kinetics of the acid-sensitive polymer acetylated dextran. Slower-degrading anti- gen-containing particles delayed the generation of maximum antigen-speci\ufb01c antibody titers, while faster-degrading antigen- containing particles augmented humoral and cellular immune responses at all time points [7]. 448 Santanu Pal et al. The stiffness or softness of a particle can also impact its uptake into APCs. Stiffer particles are subject to increased Fc-receptor- mediated phagocytosis, with a recent study of soft and stiff poly- meric nanoconstructs, showing that stiff particles are uptaken by bone-marrow-derived monocytes at \ufb01ve times the extent of soft particles. This relationship has been observed across a variety of other delivery platforms. It has been proposed that this is due to the reduced membrane deformation and energy expenditure required to phagocytose a rigid particle compared to a soft one. Thus, physical properties like size and shape can play an important role in directing NPs and MPs to their targets to elicit an effective anticancer immune response [39]. Varying the composition of NPs and MPs allows for control of the processing and subsequent presentation of antigens via either MHC-I or MHC-II, inducing primarily cellular or humoral immunity, respectively. Nano- and micro-particles have been widely used as carriers in drug delivery and are being investigated as promising delivery vehicles in immunotherapy [2]. Polymeric nanoparticles due to their size are preferentially taken up by mucosa-associated lym- phoid tissue, making them ideal for nasal and oral vaccine delivery. They require limited a", "estigated as promising delivery vehicles in immunotherapy [2]. Polymeric nanoparticles due to their size are preferentially taken up by mucosa-associated lym- phoid tissue, making them ideal for nasal and oral vaccine delivery. They require limited antigen doses for effective immunization and offer protection against enzymatic degradation in the gastrointesti- nal tract, making them suitable for oral antigen delivery. Many types of nanoparticles, including inorganic, organic, and hybrid nanopar- ticles, have been investigated for the effective delivery of drugs [67]. Nevertheless, several drawbacks have hindered their practical implementation, such as limited biocompatibility, poor physiologi- cal stability, quick bodily elimination, and nonspeci\ufb01c targeting. Biodegradable PACA nanoparticles have demonstrated enhanced secretory immune responses when orally administered with ovalbu- min in rats. PMMA nanoparticles, with slow degradation rates, promote prolonged antigen contact with immunocompetent cells, leading to persistent immunity [8]. Nanoparticles labeled with MAb speci\ufb01c to M-cells enhance the absorption and immune response of nanoparticulate vaccines. Metal-chelating polymers like EDTA and DTPA form complexes with antigenic epitopes that enable controlled antigen delivery, and histidine residues improve the speci\ufb01city of binding to metal ions in metal af\ufb01nity complexes [61]. Prophylactic mucosal gene expression vaccines consist of plasmid DNAs encoding RSV antigens coacervated with", "chitosan to form nanospheres. Intranasal administration in a murine RSV infection model induces signi\ufb01cant immune responses, reducing viral titers. Other nanocarriers, like metallic oxide particles and synthetic polymers, offer the potential for multivalent vaccine constructs [34]. Bio\ufb01lm-mediated biomimetic nano-drug delivery systems (BNDDS) have emerged as a major area of interest for biomedical research in the past few years. The low immunogenicity, low toxicity, high tumor targeting, and good biocompatibility of the bio\ufb01lm are organically integrated with the \ufb02exibility and versa- tility of the nanocarrier in this new biomimetic platform, which uses bio-nanotechnology to encapsulate synthetic NPs within a biomi- metic membrane. This has promising applications in the \ufb01eld of precision tumor therapy [16]. Further, using biomimetic and nano- technology approaches, CM-coated NPs (CM-NPs) encapsulate NP surfaces by co-extrusion, freezing-thawing/ultrasound, extru- sion/ultrasound, and stirring. Cell membranes of Bacteria [12], RBC [13], platelets [21], etc. were used for developing camou\ufb02age for delivering nano-drugs. This innovative adaptive nano-drug tar- geting platform can effectively evade immune system surveillance and clearance, extending the duration of drug circulation in the body and accomplishing speci\ufb01c delivery of nano-drugs in response to speci\ufb01c CMs [56]. Drug Delivery to the Immune System: Immunotherapies and Vaccines 449 Microspheres and lipospheres are utilized for vaccine delivery due to the intestine\u2019s imperfect barrier to small particles.

Microscopic part", "rfect barrier to small particles. These particles serve as carriers for antigens, making them suitable for controlled-release vaccine purposes. Entrapped antigens within these particles, when absorbed by M-cells, can induce immunity. Microscopic particles smaller than 10 \u03bcm can swiftly reach the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) within an hour when orally administered. Particle size is important in microparticulate systems, affecting uptake, release, and immune responses. Small micro- spheres (<10 \u03bcm) deliver antigen quickly to phagocytic cells, while larger particles require disintegration for uptake. Combining both sizes can mimic the pulsatile release of antigens, resembling prime and booster shots in immunization [38]. Microspheres of polyanhydrides, speci\ufb01cally poly(fumaric-co-sebacic) anhydride, ranging from 0.5 to 5 \u03bcm, were detected within one hour post- ingestion and remained visible in the Peyer\u2019s patch for up to 24 h following oral administration [15]. 15 Biomimicry Biomolecules like antibodies, aptamers, peptides, and small mole- cules coat nanoparticles for speci\ufb01c cell binding. Bioconjugated NPs have improved pharmacokinetics and distribution but are recognized as foreign and cleared by the body. To evade clearance, researchers explore biomimetic approaches. These include synthetic", "NPs mimicking natural structures and NPs disguised by natural structures. Both strategies hold promises for improving cancer therapy with reduced side effects and better-targeted delivery [62]. Using collagen-mimetic peptide-coated polymeric scaffolds to deliver antigen-speci\ufb01c T cells directly to tumors indicates the potential of these biomaterials to boost immunotherapy effective- ness against solid tumors [58]. Further, polymeric nanoparticles, loaded with immunotherapeutics and coated with antibody frag- ments, were used to target circulating T cells. Delivering these nanoparticles by binding to endogenous immune cells induced stronger antitumor effects than direct drug administration [49]. 450 Santanu Pal et al. 16 Micellar Systems Micelles, self-aggregated clusters of amphiphilic surfactant mole- cules used as antigen carriers, encapsulate antigens for delivery. Methods include oral smallpox vaccine production using micelles, omega-3 fatty acids, and nanoparticles, while combining a geneti- cally defective vaccinia virus with micelles enhances bioavailability and immunity. Mucosal cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response induc- tion was noticed with micelles [3]. Additionally, formulations uti- lizing micelles in transmucosal delivery demonstrate bioadhesive properties and effective agent delivery. 17 Hydrogels Hydrogels are hydrophilic polymeric networks that can absorb large volumes of water, thereby causing swelling and shrinkage to enable controlled drug release. They appear to be a promising drug delivery vehicle because of their porous and compatible nature with aqueous environments. They can be prepared as microparticles, nanoparticles, \ufb01lms, slabs, and coatings for various biomedical needs. Hydrogels that are designed to deliver drugs by diffusion- based method use", "f their porous and compatible nature with aqueous environments. They can be prepared as microparticles, nanoparticles, \ufb01lms, slabs, and coatings for various biomedical needs. Hydrogels that are designed to deliver drugs by diffusion- based method use a matrix or reservoir through mesh or pores of a hydrogel. The hydrogel membrane producing capsules, spheres, or slabs is coated on a drug-containing core, which has more concen- tration in the center of the system that helps in constant drug release. The matrix system works by the macromolecular pores or mesh, whereas the reservoir delivery system produces constant drug release that is time-independent [36]. Covalently crosslinked hydrogels have been developed that can be used as ocular drug delivery carriers. These hydrogels can remain in the lacrimal canal, which offers comfort for the patient being soft with a high swelling capacity. Whether the punctal-plug system should be used perma- nently or temporarily will be decided by the material used, silicone or collagen, respectively. The commonly used hydrogel for", "ophthalmic drug delivery systems is polyethylene glycol. The deliv- ery system that causes drug release in response to environmental changes remains ideal as there is controlled release and side effects are not seen in off-target sites. In the therapy of diseases like diabetes and cancer, which are characterized by changes in physiol- ogy, particularly in various stages of disease, a sensitive drug deliv- ery system that responds to changes in temperature, pH, glucose concentration, and ionic strength proves to be advantageous. Manipulation of the polymer composition is done to make it responsive to environmental stimuli [5]. Injectable hydrogels were designed to degrade in response to reactive oxygen species in the tumor microenvironment for the sustained release of a combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy, demonstrating that hydrogels can enable high-precision control over the release kinetics of a combination of therapeutics simultaneously [65]. Drug Delivery to the Immune System: Immunotherapies and Vaccines 451 18 Edible Vaccines Edible vaccines were produced through gene cloning and plant transformation [14]. They can induce both mucosal and systemic immune responses. Studies have demonstrated the expression of various antigens in plants, including Streptococcus mutants surface protein antigen A (SpaA) in tobacco. Animal trials have validated the antigenicity of plant-derived vaccines, such as hepatitis B surface antigen from tobacco and lettuce, bacterial diarrhea antigen from tobacco and potato, Norwalk virus antigen from potato, and foot- and-mouth disease antigen from Arabidopsis [50, 63]. 19 Plant-Derived Viruses The use of plant viruses as carriers for immunogens began with the discovery that an epitope from foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) could b", "antigen from potato, and foot- and-mouth disease antigen from Arabidopsis [50, 63]. 19 Plant-Derived Viruses The use of plant viruses as carriers for immunogens began with the discovery that an epitope from foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) could be expressed in cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV). Plant viruses, such as cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV), have been effective carriers for vaccines since 1994. Studies show that plant- virus-derived epitopes from HIV-1, mouse zona pellucida, and rabies virus induce antibody production in mice, while a plant- virus-derived canine parvovirus epitope provided complete protec- tion in a mink challenge trial [63]. 20 Melt-in Mouth Strips These strips, designed to dissolve in a child\u2019s mouth, contain immunogens aimed at protecting against rotavirus infection, a common cause of severe diarrhea and vomiting in children. The", "current rotavirus vaccine is available in liquid or freeze-dried forms, requiring refrigeration for transport and storage, which makes it costly for use in impoverished areas. Additionally, newborns some- times struggle to consume the liquid vaccine, a challenge less likely with a strip that adheres to and dissolves on the tongue within a minute (John Hopkins). 452 Santanu Pal et al. 21 Transdermal Delivery Microneedle-based transdermal delivery systems offer a highly modular approach for local immunotherapy, exploiting both biological and remotely triggered stimuli for controlled drug release. Delivery systems consist of a degradable microneedle patch, which can painlessly penetrate the skin to reach the immune cell-rich epidermis to deliver immunotherapeutic. They deliver the drugs directly to the blood capillary, which facilitates active absorp- tion as these microneedles are short and thin. Considering the drug type and dose, objective, and targets for use, the fabrication of a microneedle system has been studied and can be fabricated with photolithography and laser-mediated techniques. For manufacturing metal or polymer microneedles, laser-mediated fab- rication techniques are commonly used. Moreover, micro stereo- lithography, 3D printing, and two-photon polymerization are also used for various microneedle preparations [23]. Microneedle patches were designed to degrade and locally deliver anti-PD-1 antibodies in response to the acidic tumor microenvironment, demonstrating that pH-responsive materials can enable precise control over the local delivery of immunotherapeutics. Micronee- dles typically consist of a biodegradable polymer, such as hyaluronic acid, and are loaded with pH-sensitive nanoparticles that contain anti-PD-1 [64]. Evaluation of the bioavailabilit", " control over the local delivery of immunotherapeutics. Micronee- dles typically consist of a biodegradable polymer, such as hyaluronic acid, and are loaded with pH-sensitive nanoparticles that contain anti-PD-1 [64]. Evaluation of the bioavailability of therapeutics within the patch, as well as the biocompatibility of the delivery system, will require further studies to assess clinical translatability. 22 Delivery of Nucleic Acids Intracellular immunotherapy delivery systems face hurdles of extra- cellular and intracellular barriers. Nucleic acids, being negatively charged, require secondary agents for cellular uptake, with DNA vaccines facing the additional challenge of crossing cellular and nuclear membranes for transcription in the nucleus. mRNA, while requiring only cytosolic penetration for protein translation, faces rapid degradation without proper modi\ufb01cations or delivery systems [32, 45, 71]. Recent delivery advancements address challenges in nucleic acid-based vaccine and immunotherapy delivery. Nanopar- ticle systems overcome endosomal entrapment, aiding cytoplasmic delivery. Materials facilitating endosomal disruption enable nucleic", "acid release. Intracellular agonists, limited to local administration due to toxicity, require protection until reaching the target cells\u2019 cytosol. These innovations promise safer, more effective cancer immunotherapies with potential clinical impact. Drug Delivery to the Immune System: Immunotherapies and Vaccines 453 DNA vaccine delivery strategies utilize various physical meth- ods such as tattooing, gene guns, electroporation, ultrasound, and laser energy (such as electrical, ultrasonic, or laser beams) to induce a temporary alteration in cell membrane permeability, facilitating the uptake of immunogenic DNA into cells. Cell membrane per- meability returns to normal once the applied energy is removed after a brief duration. Gene gun technology facilitates the direct entry of DNA into cells by bombarding target DNA, as demonstrated in a study com- paring intradermal gene gun vaccination to intramuscular injection, showing higher antigen-speci\ufb01c IgG titers with gene gun immuni- zation due to direct delivery into target cells, despite using a smaller dose of DNA [31]. Tattooing serves as a physical method to inject DNA into skin cells, showing stronger and faster immune responses compared to intramuscular injection when delivering human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) DNA alone [41]. Electroporation involves applying electrical pulses to create transient pores in the skin, facilitating DNA entry; it has shown safety and ef\ufb01cacy in delivering therapeutic DNA vaccines, like Chron Vac-C, in clinical studies and is being explored for various cancers in ongoing trials [4]. Ultrasound disrupts cell membranes to facilitate DNA incor- poration, and when combined with microbubble echo contrast agents, it enhances gene transfection ef\ufb01ciency. Although utilized to deliver proteins,", " for various cancers in ongoing trials [4]. Ultrasound disrupts cell membranes to facilitate DNA incor- poration, and when combined with microbubble echo contrast agents, it enhances gene transfection ef\ufb01ciency. Although utilized to deliver proteins, its application in antigen delivery to dendritic cells for cancer immunotherapy remains unexplored. 23 mRNA Delivery Dendrimer systems have been utilized to deliver large therapeutic payloads such as replicon mRNA, which can substantially amplify the production of encoded protein. This was demonstrated in various applications, including vaccines for H1N1 in\ufb02uenza, Toxo- plasma gondii, and Ebola virus [6]. A collection of ionizable lipid nanoparticles engineered to transport mRNA vaccines to immune cells, stimulating robust cytotoxic T-cell responses [37] (Fig. 5). Further, nanoparticles are designed to adjust their negative charge, allowing them to selectively target dendritic cells upon systemic administration. In mouse models of cancer, this delivery method induced enduring type I interferon-dependent immunity. Further- more, in a phase I clinical trial involving melanoma patients, it stimulated strong and speci\ufb01c T-cell responses against antigens [26].", "454 Santanu Pal et al. Fig. 5 Schematic diagram of mRNA vaccine delivery mechanism. (Created by using BIORENDER) Unlike a conventional bolus vaccination, the implantable scaf- folds created a physical environment in vivo that secreted and presented antigens and stimulatory signals to dendritic cells over 2 weeks [69]. 24 Delivery of Cytokines The major challenge with the systemic delivery of cytokines is their rapid clearance, resulting in sub-optimal therapeutic effects. High concentrations and repeated dosing must be used to offset the clearance rate, often resulting in toxic and life-threatening side effects such as systemic in\ufb02ammation and increased vascular perme- ability [24, 28]. One way to overcome this is by delivering these cytokines in either lipid or polymeric particles. By packaging the cytokines in a particle, their half-life can be increased because they can be released over time and protected from degradation [70]. Implantable polymeric scaffolds were designed to release cytokines to recruit host dendritic cells and present cancer antigens and danger signals to activate those cells to generate speci\ufb01c and protective antitumor immunity [1]. 25 DC Targeting Receptors expressed on the surface of DCs, such as Fc receptors (FcRs) and C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), can be targeted by conjugating their respective ligands onto antigen-containing NPs and MPs, increasing the speci\ufb01city of delivery to DCs and poten- tially skewing the subsequent processing of the antigen toward a Th1 or Th2 response [19]. Ammonio methacrylate copolymers exhibit immunostimulatory properties when formed into nanopar- ticles. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB)", "crylate copolymers exhibit immunostimulatory properties when formed into nanopar- ticles. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB)", "have been identi\ufb01ed as key players in dendritic cell (DC) activation in response to nanoparticles containing quaternary ammonium groups. Further, in mice models with colorectal tumors, injecting these copolymer nanoparticles around the tumor led to signi\ufb01cant anticancer effects and improved survival rates [52]. In addition to these, nanoparticles formed from polyanhydrides have recently been investigated for their potential immune-stimulating effects as drug delivery vehicles [27] and are found to stimulate TLRs 2, 4, and 5 and results in signi\ufb01cant IFN-\u03b3 release on incubation with DCs [60]. Drug Delivery to the Immune System: Immunotherapies and Vaccines 455 26 Drug Delivery Targeting T Cells T cells with surface-conjugated synthetic nanoparticles loaded with adjuvants enhanced donor cell stimulation and tumor elimination while minimizing systemic toxicity compared to free adjuvants administered systemically [57]. A DNA nanoparticle platform was used to target T cells in circulation and reprogram them to express leukemia-recognizing CAR genes as an alternative to ex vivo CAR T cell engineering [55]. Further, synthetic arti\ufb01cial antigen- presenting cells (aAPCs) have T cell-stimulating molecules conju- gated to their surface and therefore mimic APCs [44]. Numerous other cutting-edge techniques, such as CRISPER- mediated drug delivery [66], biomaterials that can automatically adapt to their environment and release drugs in a controlled man- ner, molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) [68], micro\ufb02uidics [18], and biomaterials that respond to physical stimuli [29], are currently being investigated and could be very useful in the future of drug delivery. Regardless of the advancements in how drugs are delivered to the immune system, challenges and worries still need to be ad", "hat respond to physical stimuli [29], are currently being investigated and could be very useful in the future of drug delivery. Regardless of the advancements in how drugs are delivered to the immune system, challenges and worries still need to be addressed. The variations between species must also be consid- ered because they have a substantial impact on different delivery techniques. 27 Conclusions Immunotherapy is revolutionizing the approach to disease treat- ment and has experienced signi\ufb01cant advancements over the past \ufb01ve years. This progress is highlighted by the clinical approval of several products, including monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and adoptive cell transfer therapies. Notably, immunotherapy is emerging as one of the most effective strategies for combating cancer. Most immunomodulators are biological drugs, but their use is often constrained by factors such as large size, poor stability, limited penetration across physiological barriers, and rapid clearance by the", "reticuloendothelial system. To enhance immunotherapy, high doses and repeated intravenous injections of these biological drugs are frequently required, raising safety concerns and signi\ufb01cantly reduc- ing patient compliance. Engineering biomaterials for drug delivery presents a promising approach to improving the delivery of biolo- gics to targeted sites. Numerous drug delivery systems (DDSs) have shown remarkable immunotherapy ef\ufb01cacy in preclinical studies for various in\ufb02ammatory diseases. However, the clinical approval of DDS-mediated immunotherapy is extremely limited due to poten- tial toxicity, uncertain in vivo behavior, modest scalability, and inconvenient dosing routes. The selection of an appropriate DDS is crucial for successful translation. DDSs with excellent safety pro\ufb01les and promising industrial potential are considered optimal for immunotherapy. These include liposomes or liposome-like nanoparticles, degradable polymeric carriers such as PLGA nano- particles or microspheres, albumin-based nanoparticles, and cell carriers like red blood cells. Additionally, the choice of dosing route is essential for translation, with well-accepted delivery path- ways such as oral, buccal, transdermal, nasal, inhalation, and subcu- taneous routes being preferred. 456 Santanu Pal et al.

This innovative approach utilizes viral and non-viral particles to transport DNA or RNA into target cells, offering promising treatment avenues for conditions like cancer and genetic disorders. However, the development of these particles is complex and time-consuming, often resulting in limited yields of high-quality products. Ensuring the superiority of gene delivery systems requires meticulous assessment of various factors, including particle quanti\ufb01cation, characteristics, purity, potency, safety, and stability. Gene therapy revolves around modifying or replacing faulty genes responsible for diseases with healthy ones. Advances in molecular biology, particularly genetic engineering, have facilitated easier manipulation of genes. Genes serve dual functions: directing protein synthesis and regulating protein production. Alterations in genes can lead to dysfunctional proteins, causing diseases. Gene therapy aims to rectify this imbalance by inserting normal genes to compensate for abnormal ones or by selectively reversing mutations. Diseases like cystic \ufb01brosis, muscular dystrophy, and diabetes are potential targets for gene therapy. By repairing faulty genes at the molecular level, this approach holds immense promise for treating various disorders, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases.

Gene therapy is a hastily rising \ufb01eld that uses viral and non-viral particles to carry DNA or RNA to a patient\u2019s target cells to care for dif\ufb01cult diseases, such as cancer and genetic diseases. The development of such particles is intricate, may need years, and results in diverse products with little yields of premium particles.

Gene therapy provides modern medicine with new insights that seemed impossible 20 years ago. Development in molecular biology and, particularly, molecular medicine is now altering the fundamentals of clinical medicine. A range of viral (Figs. 1 and 2) and non-viral potentials are existing for fundamental and clinical research. Gene transfer could be accomplished through in vivo and ex vivo methods (Fig. 3).", "Unlocking the Potential of Gene Therapy: Principles and Therapeutic Applications 463 Fig. 3 In vivo versus ex vivo gene delivery Developments in molecular biological knowledge such as genetic engineering have made scientists to maneuver genes easier. A gene is a linear series of DNA that codes for certain protein [1]. Proteins carry out a variety of necessary functions in the body. DNA is made up of four bases: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine. These bases are structured to make the genes [2]. When genes are changed, the altered proteins are incapable to do their usual function, resulting in diseases. Genes are mostly associated with two sorts of function\u2014shaping the arrangement of various proteins and governing where, when, and in what quantity each protein is made [3]. Gene therapy aims to insert a normal gene to counteract an abnormal one and replace faulty genes through targeted reverse mutation. Researchers initiated researching gene therapy in 1980, and the \ufb01rst gene therapy was done in 1990 for correcting severe combined immunode\ufb01ciency [1]. Initially, gene therapy was termed as gene replacement therapy. Genetic disorders like cystic \ufb01brosis, muscular dystrophy, and diabetes could be trea- ted by gene therapy [4]. Scientists have been investigating the explanation to genetic disorders by altering and repairing the disease-causing gene. Gene therapy is one of the important avant-garde remedial technologies developed with genetic engineering and gene cloning techniques [5]. Gene therapy can revamp or even substitute the disease- causing genes at the molecular level, repairing faulty protein. After years of advancement, gene therapy has shown immense possibility in curing important disorders caused by genetic abnorm- alities such as cancer, acquired immunode\ufb01", "ute the disease- causing genes at the molecular level, repairing faulty protein. After years of advancement, gene therapy has shown immense possibility in curing important disorders caused by genetic abnorm- alities such as cancer, acquired immunode\ufb01ciency syndrome, and cardiovascular diseases. Corrected genetic molecules are delivered to the nuclei of host cells to stimulate gene expression [2, 3]. Gene therapy has the consequent to supply a patient\u2019s somatic cells with corrected genetic molecules for synthesizing precise therapeutic proteins to amend genetic diseases. In order to get a working model of gene", "delivery system, it must necessitate the full understanding of inter- face between targeting cell and gene delivery system. The gene delivery systems are made of three constituents, such as a plasmid- based gene expression system, a gene that codes a speci\ufb01c therapeu- tic protein, and a gene delivery system that manages the delivery of the gene to a precise position in the patient [3, 4]. A good gene delivery system necessitates the modi\ufb01ed genetic molecule to stay stable within the host cells [5, 6]. 464 Vijay Kumar Fig. 4 Requirements for being an optimum vector Fig. 5 Requirements for successful gene therapy Gene delivery systems are categorized as: viral, non-viral, and combined hybrid systems. Viral-mediated gene delivery systems are made of viruses that are altered to be replication-de\ufb01cient, never- theless which can deliver DNA for expression. Adenoviruses, retro- viruses, and lentiviruses are commonly used as viral gene delivery vectors [7]. Important features of a suitable vector, requirement for successful gene therapy, and dif\ufb01culties in gene therapy are repre- sented in Figs. 4, 5, and 6.", "Unlocking the Potential of Gene Therapy: Principles and Therapeutic Applications 465 Fig. 6 Dif\ufb01culties in gene therapy 2 Materials 2.1 Equipment Descriptions of particular equipment are given; however, any model of comparable capability can easily be substituted. 1.

Because of the large range of Adenovirus hosts, simple re\ufb01nement, genetic stability, big foreign gene holding capacity, and ability to transfect DNA into many cell types, this viral vector is most commonly used in gene therapy. Adenoviruses are one of the biggest and most intricate viruses, whose organization was studied with cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray diffractometry. It was found that crystal structures of an Ad proteins consisted of \ufb01ber knob, shaft, domains, penton base, hexon, and cysteine protease. Ad capsid is made up of 252 sub-units called capsomeres, which consist of 240 hexon proteins and 12 pen- ton bases. Every 12 capsid angles include penton bases draped by 5 hexons. The penton base works as a clip for the \ufb01ber protein, which appears as an antenna. Fiber is a homotrimer, where three similar polypeptides connect in the same direction, and which con- sists of three structurally and functionally unlike domains: (i) N-terminus, which connects the \ufb01ber to the penton base; (ii) C-terminus, which is accountable for fastening to the ", "ee similar polypeptides connect in the same direction, and which con- sists of three structurally and functionally unlike domains: (i) N-terminus, which connects the \ufb01ber to the penton base; (ii) C-terminus, which is accountable for fastening to the receptor; and (iii) shaft, which differs in length as per the serotype of the virus [8, 9]. First explanation of Adenoviruses took place in the early 1950s. Adenoviruses were \ufb01rst isolated from human adenoid tissue [10]. In the last seven decades, a number of diverse serotypes have been cultured and described. Adenovirus became very relevant after establishing the biology of AdV and its ability to successfully deliver the viral genome to the target cells. More notably, as AdV was not oncogenic and the genomes of usual AdV were simple to change, the creation of recombinant AdV was done. In the", "perspective of gene delivery, serotypes 5 and 2 of the subgroup C have been utilized mainly as their organization and biology are well characterized and reagents required for creating recombinant are available. AdVs of subgroup C can originate in minor to mild pulmonary infections and may be associated with conjunctival problems [11]. Unlocking the Potential of Gene Therapy: Principles and Therapeutic Applications 467 For being doing well delivery of genetically modi\ufb01ed DNA to the nucleus, viruses must assist cell-speci\ufb01c attachment, endocytosis internalization, transmission from endocytic vesicles to cytosol, release into cytoplasm, translocation from one end of the nuclear envelope to the other, and lastly expression of the delivered gene [12]. Direct injection by inhalation is the simplest form of viral delivery. Nonetheless, as the virus will multiply from the injection area, a large dose is requisite to get therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy. The multi- plication of the virus from the injection site affects the local ef\ufb01cacy and immune response. Adenoviral vectors can be used via distinct alteration of coat proteins. There is a comparatively high level of protein expression after transduction. Adenoviruses have many expected qualities that permit them to be utilized as a vector for gene therapy. Non-enveloped viruses can be preserved in lyophi- lized condition within a \ufb02acon tube or capsule; they can be shipped with no cold chain; they have high transduction ef\ufb01cacy in cells; and they can create 104 virus particles per infected cell [13]. Adeno- viruses attain appropriate transduction all the way through a high level of expression and happen to be useful in in vivo conditions [14]. Adenoviruses are one of the main promising methods for good ef\ufb01cacy in in vivo gene therapy. Adenov", "13]. Adeno- viruses attain appropriate transduction all the way through a high level of expression and happen to be useful in in vivo conditions [14]. Adenoviruses are one of the main promising methods for good ef\ufb01cacy in in vivo gene therapy. Adenoviruses are few of the main ef\ufb01cient vectors for gene delivery; nonetheless, they have certain important limitations. Few target cells have low adenoviral receptors and consequently need a large dose of vector to cause target-cell cytotoxicity. Furthermore, non-discriminating tropism can lead to transduction of untargeted cells [15]. The gravest dif\ufb01culty in the application of Ad vectors is their propensity to cause high immune and in\ufb02ammatory reactions at heavy doses [16]. 3.2 Adeno- Associated Virus (AAV) AAV is a parvovirus classi\ufb01ed under the genus Dependovirus. It was initially found as an impurity of laboratory preparations of adeno- virus. AAV is a non-enveloped single-stranded DNA virus with superior biological characteristics, genetic constancy, good gene transduction competence, and extensive use. Nonetheless, the packaging limit of AAV is small, the creation procedure is complex, and the production is expensive, so the use of AAV vectors has some limitations. Presently, there are three ways for standardizing the targeting of AAV infection: genetic modi\ufb01cation, targeted regula- tion at the transcription level, and covalent coupling alteration on capsid protein. Genetic modi\ufb01cation is mainly used to give the targeting capacity of AAV vectors.", "468 Vijay Kumar Six serotypes of AAV classi\ufb01ed under AAV2 are mostly used for gene-transfer studies [17]. AAV2 cell entry is regulated by fastening to heparin sulfate proteoglycans and \u03b1v\u03b25 integrin; \ufb01broblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR-1) may possibly also be concerned. The sharing of these molecules on numerous diverse cell types can clarify the extended in vivo expression subsequent to AAV treatment seen in the renal, brain, skeletal muscle, pulmonary tissue, and hematopoietic stem cells. AAV vectors could not bring forth adverse immune or in\ufb02ammatory responses. The main body response that could have an undesirable effect is the creation of antibodies against the virus. Gene therapy with AAV vectors has wide future uses for curing Duchenne muscle disease DMD. 3.3 Retroviral Vectors (RV) The family Retroviridae includes several viruses that have prospec- tive usefulness for gene therapy. After attachment and access into host cells, viral enzymes mediate reverse transcription and incor- poration of the virus genome into the host-cell chromatin. Retro- viral vectors have the capability for stable incorporation and permit continuing expression so that supposedly a single dose could have a lifetime remedial. The gamma-retroviruses are not able to infect dormant, non-dividing cells. Nonetheless, this problem can be mitigated by the use of lentiviral vectors. RV vectors might also be applied in the delivery of toxic genes to tumor cells, which are vigorously dividing. The capability of retrovirus-based gene delivery vectors to transmit recombinant genetic material was initially worked on in the early 1980s [7, 18]. Retroviruses incorporate with host genome to synthesize viral proteins that are obtained during gene delivery [18]. Retroviral vectors have the ability to ca", "to transmit recombinant genetic material was initially worked on in the early 1980s [7, 18]. Retroviruses incorporate with host genome to synthesize viral proteins that are obtained during gene delivery [18]. Retroviral vectors have the ability to carry DNA up to 8 kb [16]. Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) species are the normally used retroviruses. A virion nucleus is made up of round gag-encoded capsid proteins. Capsid proteins are layered with gag-coded nucleocapsid protein. The nucleus has pol-coded enzymes, reverse transcriptase, and integrase. Simple retroviruses encode gag (group-speci\ufb01c antigen), pro (protease), and pol (poly- merase) genes; complex retroviruses furthermore encode a large number of other related genes. Retroviruses were the \ufb01rst viruses to be adapted for gene delivery. Retroviruses have also been exten- sively utilized in the scienti\ufb01c experiment of gene therapy [19]. The majority of retroviral vectors used in scienti\ufb01c experiments are based on the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV). Moloney murine leukemia virus is an extensively characterized virus. The best retroviral vector for gene therapy should be cell-speci\ufb01c, precisely synchronized, and secure. Ef\ufb01cacy of delivery is vital, as it will decide the ef\ufb01ciency of gene therapy [19]. In order to go into a host cell, retroviral vectors exercise the communications among cellular receptors and virally coded proteins [19].", "Unlocking the Potential of Gene Therapy: Principles and Therapeutic Applications 469 Blending of viral and cellular membranes begins the internali- zation of the viral nucleus [20]; the viral envelope unites with the cell membrane. Envelope glycoprotein (Env) of retroviruses is accountable for deciding tropism. Fastening of Env to cellular receptor and combination of viral and cellular membranes are the initial stages of entry of virus. Retroviruses pursue an unusual replication cycle during trans- formation of single-stranded RNAs into double-stranded DNA in the infected cell. Viral DNA production occurs in cytoplasm by virus-encoded DNA polymerase, which is known as reverse tran- scriptase. Viral DNA comes inside the nucleus, and viral DNA takes the loop or ring form. Ring-formed DNA works as a draft for RNA synthesis [21]. While viral DNA comes into the nucleus, it incor- porates with the DNA of the host cell. Retroviruses transfer their DNA to the host cell genome at some stage in mitotic division. The majority of retroviruses infect host cells that are actively dividing in mitotic division. This feature guards normal tissue and targets the cancerous cells. Infected cells are then transcribed and spliced. Viral RNA is transported to cytoplasm and then translated. Spliced viral RNA is packed into viral particles. Retroviral particles encase two copies of complete viral RNA, having entire genetic information essential for virus replication, with capsid [19]. Studies found that de\ufb01nite packaging of retroviral genomic RNA was carried out. Retroviral genome packaging is usually found \ufb02anked by the bind- ing donor (SD) region and the gag start codon. Virion maturation happens through the budding of the particle from the cell [7]. The translational method of the host produ", "s carried out. Retroviral genome packaging is usually found \ufb02anked by the bind- ing donor (SD) region and the gag start codon. Virion maturation happens through the budding of the particle from the cell [7]. The translational method of the host produces and transforms viral proteins. Recently produced viral proteins and complete RNAs unite to produce a new virus form. A retrovirus infects the target cell through offering communication amid viral envelope protein and cell exterior receptor on the target cell. The virus then pre- sented to the site where its single-stranded RNA alters into double- stranded DNA. Double-stranded DNA is presented to the nucleus and incorporated into the host cell genome. Firm binding of viral DNA to the host genome is bene\ufb01cial because it will offer long- term expression of transgenes necessary for remedial effect. One of the limitations of present retroviral transfer techniques is that they are not precise to types of target cells [20]. The capability of retro- viruses to penetrate its genomes to host cell allows them to make stable alterations in the host cell. This stability is better than other viruses such as adenovirus, herpes simplex virus, and papilloma virus. 3.4 Lentivirus (LV) Lentivirus (LV) is composed of a single-stranded RNA and has been extensively used to deliver gene. As a gene delivery means, LV incorporation of the host genome may lead to needless non-target insertion mutations, which is a safety threat. LV is less commonly used than AAV and AdV. Integration-de\ufb01cient lentiviral", "l", "vectors (IDLV) have high transduction competence of LVs and show reduced insertion mutations. 470 Vijay Kumar Lentiviral systems provide gene delivery to non-dividing cells. This attribute is a bene\ufb01t for a variety of gene therapy purposes utilized in aiming in post-mitotic and extremely differentiated cells. Because of this, lentiviral vectors can be utilized for transgene expression to neuron cells [20]. Lentiviruses have a complex geno- mic structure; they have additional genes which control viral gene expression, adjust viral replication in infected cells, and are also associated with the maintenance of infection [22]. Tropism of lentiviral vectors is based on the type of envelope protein utilized for virus production [7]. The mainly utilized Env protein is \u201cvesic- ular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G).\u201d This protein allows the virus maximum titration values and a high tropism [23]. Lenti- viral vectors do not involve breaking of the nuclear membrane for incorporation. Often, pseudotype lentiviral vectors are developed by vesicular stomatitis virus envelope (VSV-G). VSV-G provides large host-cell variety and increased vector particle stability, which are suitable for ex vivo gene alteration. The latest-designed lenti- viral gene transfer systems have several features of retroviral sys- tems. A viral genome incorporates with host chromosomes, and genes that are required to stay forever are placed [20]. 4 Conclusion In conclusion, gene therapy has emerged as a transformative approach with the potential to correct and replace faulty genes, thus treating various genetic and acquired diseases, including can- cer, immunode\ufb01ciencies, and cardiovascular disorders.

Advances in genetic engineering and molecular biology have enabled the devel- opment of sophisticated viral and non-viral vectors for gene deliv- ery, each with unique properties suited to speci\ufb01c applications. Viral vectors, including adenovirus, adeno-associated virus, retrovirus, and lentivirus, have shown signi\ufb01cant promise for in vivo and ex vivo gene transfer. However, these systems must address chal- lenges like immune responses, insertional mutagenesis, and cell- speci\ufb01c targeting to improve their ef\ufb01cacy and safety. The continuous re\ufb01nement of gene delivery systems is key to the future success of gene therapy. Stable integration, targeted delivery, and long-term gene expression are critical features for effective therapeutic outcomes. Hybrid systems combining both viral and non-viral components offer a potential pathway for enhancing delivery precision while minimizing adverse effects. As gene therapy technology advances, it brings hope for treat- ing currently untreatable genetic disorders and acquired diseases at a molecular level. Regulatory and ethical considerations will also play a role in de\ufb01ning the path forward for gene therapy as a widely", "accepted medical treatment. With further research, gene therapy is positioned to become an integral component of modern medicine, providing new therapeutic avenues and transforming clinical practice.

It may involve the replacement of lost cells, such as the infusion of red blood cells to treat anemia, the adminis- tration of platelets for cases of low platelet count that require immediate attention, or the application of T lymphocytes to regu- late the immune system and treat cancer, for example. The term \u201ccell replacement therapy\u201d refers to this particular type of cellular therapy, which is utilized rather frequently in medical programs that encompass both human and animal applications.

Stem cells and progenitor cells, which are cells that have the ability to make new cells, are utilized in the event that these conditions present themselves (Fig. 2). Cell therapy represents a cutting-edge breakthrough in the \ufb01eld of medicine, aligning with the transformative power of biotechnology. Cell therapies, just like other treatments, rely heavily on the remarkable scienti\ufb01c break- throughs and technological advancements that have taken place. There are several cell-based therapies currently in the experimental stage, including hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation, which has gained widespread acceptance as a treatment for blood- related disorders [1, 2]. 474 Pradeep Kumar Ram et al. Fig. 1 Cell therapy for different organs of the body However, the bulk of cell-based therapies are currently in the experimental stage. It is possible to classify cell treatments accord- ing to the particular medical disorders that they are intended to treat, such as neurological, cardiovascular, or ophthalmological conditions. In addition, they can be categorized according to whether the cells that are utilized are removed from the same individual and then returned to them (autologous) or whether they are obtained from a donor (allogeneic). There is also the usual practice of classifying cell therapies according to the types of cells that are utilized. Only a small number of cell-based medica- tions have made it to the latter stages of clinical testing and market- ing authorization [3]. This indicates that the majority of cell-based medicines are still in the early stages of research. This is still a developing area of science proved by the experience that is now being gained in this sector. As a re", "nd market- ing authorization [3]. This indicates that the majority of cell-based medicines are still in the early stages of research. This is still a developing area of science proved by the experience that is now being gained in this sector. As a result, it is of the utmost", "importance to have a constant process of learning and improve- ment, which requires close coordination between trial physicians and laboratory researchers. The purpose of this collaboration is to conduct an analysis of the data gathered from the preliminary clinical trials and then make use of that information to improve the product\u2019s quality, which will ultimately result in the creation of more sophisticated remedies. In the \ufb01eld of gene-modi\ufb01ed T cells, speci\ufb01cally in the procedure of developing anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell treatments, speci\ufb01c examples of this phenomenon can be observed. B-cell leukemias have been successfully treated with these therapies, which entail the modi\ufb01ca- tion of T cells genetically in order to enable them to recognize the CD19 antigen that is present on B cells. These therapies have shown a remarkably high level of ef\ufb01ciency. More than 20 years of clinical research and repeated cycles of improvement in the labora- tory have led to the creation of these medicines [4\u20136]. Cell-Based Therapies and Drug Delivery: Advancements and Challenges 475 Fig. 2 Cell therapy based on stem cells and non-stem cells 2 Technologies Utilizing Cells in Treating Diseases It is increasingly clear that the \ufb01eld of cell treatment will undergo signi\ufb01cant changes in the future. The remarkable effectiveness of", "immune cell therapy has been widely observed, contributing to its growing potential. Recent discoveries in immune cell-based treat- ments demonstrate the use of viral vector transduction technology to introduce modi\ufb01ed genes into T cells [7]. This is done with the precise aim of targeting particular forms of blood cancers. During the 1970s, scientists made signi\ufb01cant advancements in viral vector technology, which has since been re\ufb01ned and adapted for various applications, including its use in the medical \ufb01eld. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, this technology was \ufb01rst used in the early stages of in vivo gene treatments, resembling the work of a neuro- scientist. Furthermore, it is currently being employed in the realm of cell therapy. The groundbreaking technology has undergone signi\ufb01cant improvements and is now being utilized in therapeutic applications. Instead of solely focusing on speci\ufb01c cell types, it could be advantageous to approach the topic of cell therapy from a technological perspective. To effectively analyze the different technologies used in cell therapy, it is helpful to categorize each methodology into speci\ufb01c technology domains. 476 Pradeep Kumar Ram et al. Following is a list of classi\ufb01cations that are offered for technol- ogies that utilize cells in a variety of different ways to treat diseases, along with a brief explanation of each technological domain: (a) Methods via which somatic cells are utilized (b) The technologies that can be used to achieve cell immortality (c) Modi\ufb01cation of cells outside of living organisms through the use of viral vector technology (d) The use of methods that involve viral vector technology for the alteration of genes in living organisms (e) Technologies that allow for the altering of genomes (f) Methods for the ma", " of living organisms through the use of viral vector technology (d) The use of methods that involve viral vector technology for the alteration of genes in living organisms (e) Technologies that allow for the altering of genomes (f) Methods for the manipulation of biological materials 2.1 Somatic Cell Technologies \u201cSomatic cell technologies\u201d is the phrase used to describe the use of advanced instruments and methods to the manipulation and inves- tigation of all bodily cells, except reproductive cells. In order to create a speci\ufb01c cell product, this method uses cells that have been isolated, multiplied, and/or differentiated from the body. After that, a patient receives the product in order to carry out targeted therapeutic therapy. As such, the technological dif\ufb01culties involved in translation are similar, and this is true regardless of the variety of cell types that fall within this group of technologies. These cells include chondrocytes, platelets, and red blood cells. Tissue stem cells are also included in this group of cells; they include skin stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, and hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Even while the methods for differentiation, propagation, and puri- \ufb01cation may be highly sophisticated, overall technological innova- tion is frequently fairly low. For a considerable amount of time, certain treatments that utilize this technology\u2014such as blood", "transfusions and bone marrow transplants\u2014have been acknowl- edged as the most successful options. These treatments have his- torically been chosen because of how simple it is to reach and use these cells for bene\ufb01cial purposes. Worldwide, a number of addi- tional cell types, such as chondrocytes and skin stem cells, are presently being used in therapeutic settings. Translational scientists place a high importance on MSCs and their subpopulations, and clinical trials are presently underway worldwide. There is hope that progenitor cells or other stem cells targeted to particular tissues would prove to be effective therapeutics. There are several applica- tions for these cells. Every tissue has a relatively small quantity of stem cells in it. One of the reasons it is challenging to produce a signi\ufb01cant amount of stem cells is that it seems that these cells\u2019 capacity to divide is hampered when they are taken out of the body. The resolution of these major obstacles is required to achieve commercial feasibility for any treatment of this kind. Numerous varieties of immune cells are now being produced as cell therapies. These include macrophages, dendritic cells, gamma- delta T cells, regulatory T cells (Treg), tumor in\ufb01ltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and viral reconstitution T cells. These cell types have experienced several phases of development over the course of clinical trials. Even though these immune cells fall under the category of somatic cell technologies, there may be more complicated issues involved in implementing their utilization than are frequently seen in this \ufb01eld. Conversely, T cells that have undergone genetic alteration via the use of viral vectors are categorized as belonging to a distinct technology category because of the speci\ufb01c type of modi\ufb01cation that wa", "ilization than are frequently seen in this \ufb01eld. Conversely, T cells that have undergone genetic alteration via the use of viral vectors are categorized as belonging to a distinct technology category because of the speci\ufb01c type of modi\ufb01cation that was applied. Cell-Based Therapies and Drug Delivery: Advancements and Challenges 477 2.2 Immortalized Cell Lines Among the many examples of this technical \ufb01eld, the brain stem cell line CTX is a particularly noteworthy example. The CTX cell line is a clonal cell line that had its origins in the cortical brain tissue of embryonic brains. The c-mycERTAM transgene, which consisted of a single copy, was delivered into the organism through the process of retroviral infection. The c-mycERTAM method permits the ef\ufb01cient creation of CTX cells on a large scale. This is accom- plished through the implementation of conditional regulation through the utilization of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT). Despite the fact that immortalization techniques have been around for a considerable amount of time, they are not currently being utilized in the \ufb01eld of cell therapy to a signi\ufb01cant extent. In the event that the clinical study that is now being conducted turns out to be successful, it is extremely probable that there will be a larger emphasis placed on this particular \ufb01eld of technology [8].", "478 Pradeep Kumar Ram et al. 2.3 Ex Vivo Gene Modi\ufb01cation of Cells Using Viral Vector Technologies Ex vivo gene modi\ufb01cations made with viral vector technology are utilized for cell therapy applications in a variety of cell types, with T cells, HSCs, and MSCs being the most common cell types using this technique. The modi\ufb01cation of genes in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) has the potential to be used in the treatment of diseases such as adenosine deaminase severe combined immunode- \ufb01ciency disease (ADA SCID). In addition, gene-modi\ufb01ed mesen- chymal stem cells, also known as MSCs, are currently being evaluated in preliminary clinical trials for the treatment of many illnesses, including advanced cancer [9]. With regard to T cells, which now hold the preeminent position in this area of technology, the technique entails genetically changing the T cells in a variety of different ways in order to speci\ufb01cally target and activate them. This ultimately results in the targeted destruction of a wide range of various malignancies. At this time, pharmaceutical companies are aggressively working to translate gene-modi\ufb01ed T-cell treatments into clinical practice. On the other hand, there is a pressing require- ment to expand the capacity for the production of viral vectors as well as transduced T cells in accordance with good manufacturing procedures (GMP). 2.4 In Vivo Gene Modi\ufb01cation of Cells Using Viral Vector Technologies Introducing genetic material into the body in a direct manner is what in vivo gene therapy is all about. Using modi\ufb01ed viruses with targeted viral vectors has become a widely used delivery approach worldwide. Through the process of in vivo infection, these vectors are introduced into cells, just as a biologist would observe and analyze. Various types of viral vec", "\ufb01ed viruses with targeted viral vectors has become a widely used delivery approach worldwide. Through the process of in vivo infection, these vectors are introduced into cells, just as a biologist would observe and analyze. Various types of viral vectors, such as retroviral, lentiviral, adenoviral, and adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors, are com- monly used in advanced treatment medicinal products [10]. With its versatile capabilities, viral vector technology can be used in a wide range of cell types to achieve speci\ufb01c therapeutic goals. There are a number of possible applications for gene therapy, some of which include the treatment of cancer, neurological illnesses, genetic disorders, infectious diseases, and anomalies in the cardio- vascular system. As the subject of technology is so vast and com- plex, there are a number of unique challenges that arise when translating words and phrases. It is important to note that establish- ing cell targeting speci\ufb01city and maintaining regulated expression are among the most signi\ufb01cant challenges that many medicines that are now in the process of being developed must overcome. It is a well-established technique that holds substantial potential in the \ufb01eld of cell-based therapies. Gene therapy, which is also known as genetic treatment, is another name for this technological advancement.", "Cell-Based Therapies and Drug Delivery: Advancements and Challenges 479 2.5 Genome Editing Technologies These powerful tools, including meganucleases, zinc \ufb01nger nucleases (ZFNs), and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), have been widely used to edit genomes in various cell types and organisms. Recently, TALENs have become widely accepted by scientists due to their simplicity compared to meganucleases and ZFNs. Due to its high ef\ufb01cacy and cost- effectiveness, the utilization of CRISPRCas9 systems for precise genome editing has gained signi\ufb01cant acceptance among research- ers in the life sciences \ufb01eld [11]. This is because these systems are able to achieve a higher level of accuracy and effectiveness. Targeted gene editing is a method that is currently in its early stages of development, with promising potential applications in translational research. However, its potential makes it a technology that could be disruptive in the \ufb01eld of cell therapy. There is a high probability that the initial concentration of these gene editing-based treatments will be on conditions that are associated with blood cells and are brought on by a single gene mutation. 2.6 Cell Plasticity Technologies The \ufb01eld of cell plasticity draws on \ufb01ndings over the past 50 years that suggest some, if not most, cells are capable of differentiating into cell types that were previously believed to be outside of their usual spectrum of specialization. In 1962, a tadpole\u2019s intestine contained the nucleus of a fully developed cell, which John Gurdon swapped with the nucleus of a fertilized frog egg cell. The fact that the egg cell changed and matured into a new frog showed that the fully grown cell still possessed the necessary genetic information to generate all cell types. In the 1990s,", "Gurdon swapped with the nucleus of a fertilized frog egg cell. The fact that the egg cell changed and matured into a new frog showed that the fully grown cell still possessed the necessary genetic information to generate all cell types. In the 1990s, scientists were able to success- fully construct an animal known as \u201cDolly the sheep\u201d by using nuclear transfer technology [12]. This achievement provided additional evidence of the cellular plasticity that was previously unknown. The creation of mouse and human embryonic stem cell lines was a huge step forward that made it possible to conduct research on developmental biology and cell plasticity in a laboratory environment. Not only are we able to improve our capabilities to a greater extent through the utilization of this technology, but we are also able to increase our access to cellular treatments. Two examples of the kinds of important devel- opments that have happened in the \ufb01eld recently are the identi\ufb01ca- tion of human and mouse-induced pluripotent stem (IPS) cells as well as the discovery of trans differentiation, which is the process of changing one type of specialized cell into another without going through the pluripotency stage. There is a large amount of promise in technologies that are based on cell plasticity, and it is expected that these technologies will have a big impact in therapeutic con- texts. This is mostly due to the high probability of having an abundant supply of cells and the capability of partially matching the cell product that is produced with the patient getting it.", " patient getting it.", "480 Pradeep Kumar Ram et al. 3 Different Kinds of Cells Are Utilized in the Process of Cell Treatment These cells include mature cells such as T cells or dendritic cells, in addition to adult stem cells that are derived from a tissue source that was collected not too long ago. The utilization of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in therapeutic treatments is an application of mature cells that is both promising and an emerging \ufb01eld of application. CD4+ Foxp3+ Tregs are long-lasting cells that block immune responses in vivo in a manner that is both commanding and antigen-speci\ufb01c. Treg cells have been shown to be effective in lowering all immunity in graft-versus-host disease models. Tregs also provide long-lasting protection against auto-in\ufb02ammatory diseases in mice models. Pre- clinical trials involving human patients are now being conducted in order to evaluate the ef\ufb01cacy and safety of the CD4+ Foxp3+ Treg therapy. The dendritic cell is yet another fascinating fully mature cell type that is now being researched for its potential applications in cell therapy. Both innate and adaptive immune responses are initiated and controlled by dendritic cells, which are specialized antigen-presenting cells that arise from the bone marrow. Dendritic cells play an important part in both sets of immune responses [13\u2013 15]. The employment of dendritic cells as a therapeutic approach for immunotherapy, in conjunction with the utilization of onco- gene inhibitors, appears to be the preferable method of treating patients. The effectiveness of targeted therapy for tumors in renal cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma is currently being investigated in human clinical research. These investigations are currently being carried out. 4 The Practices of Regenerative Medicine and C", " therapy for tumors in renal cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma is currently being investigated in human clinical research. These investigations are currently being carried out. 4 The Practices of Regenerative Medicine and Cell Therapy The discipline of regenerative medicine, which is a revolutionary medical specialty, has the ability to repair and rejuvenate damaged organs and tissues. The results of preclinical studies carried out on laboratory animals suggest that stem cell therapy has the potential to become a conventional treatment option for a variety of debili- tating diseases that affect companion animals. On the other hand, in order to determine whether or not something is safe and effec- tive, comprehensive clinical trials performed on a large scale are required before it can be adopted. The journey has begun with the beginning of clinical research for illnesses such as osteoarthritis, tendon repair, and chronic renal failure. These studies are now being conducted. 4.1 Veterinary Medicine Therapeutic Uses Douglas J. Hershel was the \ufb01rst veterinarian to use stem cell-based technology for the treatment of equine suspensory ligament des- mitis. He applied this technology in the \ufb01eld of veterinary", "medicine. Because of the nature of this application, it was necessary to inject substantial volumes directly, ranging from 20 to 60 milli- liters. In order to repair a damaged ligament, a bone marrow aspirate was extracted from the sternum and then injected into the area. The \ufb01ndings indicate that the technique demonstrated a greater rate of progress in terms of returning to athletic function when compared to traditional therapy. On the other hand, consid- ering the limited number of stem cells that were present in the bone marrow aspirate, it is highly implausible that the outcomes that were described were completely attributed to the stem cells. In the general population of nucleated cells that can be found in human and cat bone marrow, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) represent a minority. It is hypothesized that MSCs are also present in other species, such as horses, at proportions that are comparable to those seen in human bone marrow. According to the \ufb01ndings of these investigations, the percentage of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that are present in mononuclear cells that have been isolated from a Ficoll density gradient or bone marrow aspirate falls somewhere between 0.001% and 0.01%. A further reduction in the number of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in the \ufb01rst bone marrow aspirate would be achieved through the utilization of the Ficoll density gradient separation technique, which eliminates a variety of cell types. Granulocytes and immature myeloid precursors are just two of the various types of cells that can be found in the sample. It is possible that the potential therapeutic impact of bone marrow aspirate is connected to the presence of a number of bioactive compounds in the acellular fraction. These molecules include growth factors that are released by plate", "d in the sample.

These molecules include growth factors that are released by platelets or other cells. Cell-Based Therapies and Drug Delivery: Advancements and Challenges 481 5 Advancements and Challenges in Drug Delivery Targeting the cells that are implicated in the onset and progression of diseases is now critically important due to advancements in molecular pharmacology and a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying most diseases. This is particularly true for most serious illnesses that need to be treated with medications that have a wide spectrum of side effects. As a result, accurate tissue targeting is necessary in order to reduce the amount of systemic exposure. Recent drug delivery systems are developed with the use of cutting-edge technology in order to speed up the transport of drugs throughout the body to the precise location where they are needed [16]. This helps to maximize therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy while simultaneously avoiding off-target accumulation in the body. The term \u201cdrug delivery systems\u201d refers to technological systems that incorporate the formulation and storage of drug molecules into appropriate forms for administration, such as tablets or solutions. They accelerate the delivery of medications to the particular spot in", "the body that is being targeted, which results in the enhancement of therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy while simultaneously reducing the buildup of off-target substances in the body. Drugs can be administered to the body through a variety of routes, including oral route, buccal and sublingual routes, nasal and ophthalmic routes, transdermal and subcutaneous routes, anal and transvaginal routes, and intravesical routes of administration [17, 18]. The components of the drug are responsible for the changes that it causes in the body system when it is consumed, and they are also responsible for the physiochemical qualities that the medication possesses. Because of the improved systemic circulation and the ability to modulate the pharmacologi- cal action of the drug, distributed drug delivery systems have been utilized successfully in the treatment of diseases and the enhance- ment of health over the course of the past few decades. Because of the development of pharmacology and pharmacokinetics, the notion of controlled release came into existence. This was due to the fact that the importance of drug release in determining the success of therapeutic interventions was demonstrated. The con- trolled-release formulation of a drug was made available for the \ufb01rst time in the 1950s, and ever since then, it has garnered a great deal of interest due to the major advantages it possesses in comparison to traditional drugs. The rate at which it delivers medications is predetermined, and it does so for a predetermined amount of time. Furthermore, the lifespan of regulated drug delivery systems might range from a few days to several years because they are immune to physiological circumstances. Moreover, it provides spatial control over the drug\u2019s delivery, allowing for either constant or variable rele", "span of regulated drug delivery systems might range from a few days to several years because they are immune to physiological circumstances. Moreover, it provides spatial control over the drug\u2019s delivery, allowing for either constant or variable release rates. Furthermore, it improves the drug\u2019s solubility, target site accumulation, ef\ufb01cacy, pharmacological activity, pharmacoki- netic properties, patient acceptance, and compliance while concur- rently lowering its toxicity. In order to provide more targeted, easy, and controllable delivery, a number of drug delivery systems have been created in the last few years using contemporary techniques. Speci\ufb01c features that are exclusive to a given pharmaceutical deliv- ery system dictate its release rate and mechanism. This is mostly due to differences in the morphological, chemical, and physical char- acteristics, which will ultimately affect these substances\u2019 af\ufb01nities for various pharmaceutical drugs. It has been determined that diffusion, chemical reaction, solvent reaction, and stimuli control are the most signi\ufb01cant release mechanisms. Consider the majority of cancer cells\u2019 ability to proliferate via the lymphatic system and permeable blood vessels. 482 Pradeep Kumar Ram et al. This means that the medicine can simply penetrate through this hole and reach the tissues that are being targeted. In the adminis- tration of a wide variety of chemotherapeutic drugs, EPR (Enhanced Permeability and Retention) is a passive diffusion mech- anism that has been extensively investigated and extensively uti- lized. Passive targeting may have its limitations in terms of", "extensively uti- lized. Passive targeting may have its limitations in terms of", "speci\ufb01city and selectivity, but these issues can be effectively addressed by employing active targeting. For this process to occur, all that is needed are attachments to the carriers, speci\ufb01c ligands, and molecules that can actively bind to the surface of target tissues. By preventing uptake by non-target cells, the chances of experiencing adverse consequences and toxicity are signi\ufb01cantly reduced. Despite the advancements in the development of targeted drugs, there remain considerable challenges to address. These include issues such as immunogenicity, the potential breakdown of drugs in lysosomes after being taken up by macrophages, and the need for ligands to selectively target speci\ufb01c cells. Through the process of responsive stimuli targeting, these delivery systems have the ability to precisely reach the desired cells by manipulating the physical or chemical characteristics of the target cells. Quantities such as pH, temperature, ultrasonography, magnetic \ufb01eld, and electric \ufb01eld are examples of these physical qualities. Cell-Based Therapies and Drug Delivery: Advancements and Challenges 483 6 Drug Delivery Systems and Applications There has been signi\ufb01cant progress made in recent years toward the effective creation of drug delivery systems based on organic, inor- ganic, and hybrid nanoparticles as drug carriers for active targeting, particularly in chemotherapy. Recent drug delivery systems (DDS) have been developed with enhanced features, including small parti- cle size, higher permeability, increased solubility, ef\ufb01cacy, speci\ufb01c site targeting, stability, toxicity, and sustained delivery. These improvements have been made possible by the formulation of DDS. When compared to conventional dose forms, they have the potential to dramatically improve the performance of", "y, speci\ufb01c site targeting, stability, toxicity, and sustained delivery. These improvements have been made possible by the formulation of DDS. When compared to conventional dose forms, they have the potential to dramatically improve the performance of therapeutic agents. In the process of developing an optimal drug delivery system, recent drug delivery systems are acknowledged as the most recent developments and innovative understanding of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic behavior of medicines. Due to the fact that these DDS are transporters, they are able to maintain medicine concentrations within the therapeutic range for an extended period of time while simultaneously delivering material to the therapeutic site. The commercial and therapeutic success of the invention is intimately related to the adoption of the delivery mechanism via which the innovation is delivered. In order to accomplish this, it would be necessary to involve patients at an early stage in the development process and identify any potential issues. Researchers have identi\ufb01ed the potential bene\ufb01ts of nano- technology in greatly enhancing medicine delivery methods over the course of time [19, 20]. The following are some of the drug delivery systems.", "484 Pradeep Kumar Ram et al. 6.1 Red Blood Cell Membrane- Camou\ufb02aged Nanoparticles Drug Delivery System The nanoparticles that are hidden by the membrane of red blood cells represent a novel category of medication delivery technolo- gies. The characteristics of red blood cells (RBCs) and the biological relevance of these cells make it possible for them to be utilized as an effective system for the camou\ufb02aging of nanoparti- cles. Because red blood cells (RBCs) are the most abundant circu- lating cells in the body, they are an attractive vehicle for drug delivery. Their biocompatibility (non-immunogenic), biodegrad- ability, and longer circulating half-life make them an ideal vehicle for drug delivery. Several types of bioactive chemicals, including enzymes, medicines, proteins, and macromolecules, have been found to be transported by engineered red blood cells, which have been found to be ef\ufb01cient transporters for these substances [21]. Due to the fact that they are so abundant, red blood cell membranes act as a \u201ccamou\ufb02age,\u201d which enables nanoparticles to combine the advantages of native red blood cell membranes with those of the nanomaterial. With the goal of loading therapeutic substances onto red blood cells (RBCs) without compromising their structure or the physiological function of RBCs, a number of different techniques have been devised. By imitating red blood cells (RBCs) and interacting with their surroundings, coated nano- particles will be able to generate long-lasting systemic circulation when administered. Creating nanoparticles that are camou\ufb02aged with RBCs is typically accomplished through the use of sonication. The in situ polymerization, micro\ufb02uidic electroporation, and extru- sion techniques are some more approaches that can be utilized for the fusing of", "g nanoparticles that are camou\ufb02aged with RBCs is typically accomplished through the use of sonication. The in situ polymerization, micro\ufb02uidic electroporation, and extru- sion techniques are some more approaches that can be utilized for the fusing of RBCs with nanoparticles [22]. On the other hand, each one has a number of bene\ufb01ts and drawbacks with regard to the synthesis, the dif\ufb01culties associated with scaling up, the repeatabil- ity, and the character of the end product. The RBC membrane- derived vesicle is obtained through hypotonic treatment (dialysis, hemolysis, or dilutions) of fresh whole blood from an organism prior to the fusion. Furthermore, because of the huge number of cell membranes, red blood cell vesicles are intrinsically biocompati- ble and biodegradable. Furthermore, they are able to readily reach high load capacity, which results in larger accumulation at the target region. Nano-formulations that are coated with erythrocyte mem- branes have been utilized widely in the \ufb01eld of anticancer research (with signi\ufb01cant success), cardiovascular disorders, and encephalopathy. 6.2 Drug Nanocarriers Based on Hyaluronic Acid Hyaluronic acid is one of the strategies that can be used to deliver drugs. Hyaluronic acid is a new polymer that has the potential to be utilized in the production of medicine delivery systems. The linear macromolecular mucopolysaccharide that it possesses is composed of N-acetylglucosamine saccharide units and glucuronic acid units that are proportionately coupled to one another [23]. Additionally, it is capable of being associated with a particular cell surface", "ally, it is capable of being associated with a particular cell surface", "receptor, in addition to exhibiting biocompatibility, biodegradabil- ity, and high viscoelasticity values. As long as the integrated phar- maceuticals are delivered in a consistent manner, it makes sense to employ hyaluronic acid as a carrier for ocular drug delivery. Hya- luronic acid is a natural component of eye tissue and plays a signi\ufb01- cant role in the healing process of wounds. In addition to enhancing medication targeting, they contribute to the thickening, sustained release, and transdermal absorption of active pharmaceu- tical ingredients. The utilization of active targeted HA-based drug nanocarriers resulted in a signi\ufb01cant improvement in the distribu- tion of several drugs to cancer cells. In addition, biocompatible drug carriers consisting of lipid nanoparticles that have been coated with a suitable HA have been produced. These nanoparticles have a signi\ufb01cant potential for targeted drug delivery to the target tissue while simultaneously decreasing the risk of adverse effects and hurting other tissues. Using HA-based nanocarriers for cancers that have heightened expression of the CD44 receptor has a num- ber of advantages, including improved drug delivery, increased therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy, higher cytotoxicity, and a signi\ufb01cant reduction in the formation of tumors, in addition to a high potential for targeted chemotherapy. When an HA-based nanocarrier is mixed with doxorubicin (DOX) and cisplatin (CDDP), it can be created as a CD44-targeting anticancer drug delivery system. Additionally, these micelles demonstrated higher cellular uptake and stronger cellular growth suppression than free medications. An acid-sensitive drug release, CD44-targeted delivery, high biocompatibility, and biodegradability are some of the characteristics that make HA- DOX-CDDP micelles ", "igher cellular uptake and stronger cellular growth suppression than free medications. An acid-sensitive drug release, CD44-targeted delivery, high biocompatibility, and biodegradability are some of the characteristics that make HA- DOX-CDDP micelles a promising candidate for a drug delivery system. Cell-Based Therapies and Drug Delivery: Advancements and Challenges 485 6.3 Hexagonal Boron Nitride Nanosheet Drug Delivery System Boron nitride (BN) is a crystalline substance that has a stoichiome- try of nitrogen (N) and boron (B) atoms that is balanced. This substance can be found in a number of different con\ufb01gurations, including cubic BN (c-BN), hexagonal BN (h-BN), wurtzite BN (w- BN), and rhombohedral BN (r-BN). In addition, it is some- times referred to as white graphene, and also considered to be an analog of graphite. As an alternative for the, the B\u2013N atoms there is a strong covalent link that holds the carbon atoms together, which results in the formation of interlocking rings. Owing to the fact that this combination is somewhat ionic, the B\u2013N bonds that it contains are polar. This is a distinctive property of the compound. Graphene oxide (H-BN) is an insulator that has broad uses in a variety of sectors, including cosmetics, dentistry, cement, ceramics, and most importantly, medicine, where it is used as a drug carrier in a manner that is comparable to graphene or graphene oxide. According to the \ufb01ndings of the study conducted by Jedrzejczak-Silicka and her colleagues, the proliferation of MCF-7 cell line cultures was shown to be reduced when compared to the proliferation of normal", " shown to be reduced when compared to the proliferation of normal", "L929 cell lines after being exposed to H-BN that was loaded with gold particles. Sonication treatment was used to exfoliate H-BN, which was then functionalized with gold particles for the investiga- tions and assessed using the Neutral Red (NR) uptake assay. H-BN was exfoliated through chemical treatment utilizing a modi\ufb01ed version of Hummers\u2019 procedure with sonication treatment. In a different research investigation, the in situ deposition of Pd on the surface of H-BN nanosheets resulted in the nanosheets acquiring photothermal characteristics. Because of this, the compound was able to have a high loading capacity for doxorubicin, which is a medicine that is used to treat cancer, and it also operates very well as a drug delivery carrier. During the course of the trial, the medicine was administered to mice for a period of two weeks, and the results showed a great reduction of tumor growth. The drop in pH, which resulted in the release of doxorubicin from the nanohybrids, as well as a concurrent increase in glutathione concentration and near- infrared radiation (NIR) made this possible. Another factor that contributed to this was the presence of near-infrared radiation. H-BN coupled with DNA oligonucleotide and copper (II) phthalocyanine (CuPc) was shown to be effective as a thera- peutic agent in photodynamic treatment (PDT), as well as in situ monitoring. This was demonstrated by another successful investi- gation. Boron compound is currently being acknowledged as a chemotherapeutic drug that is considered to be successful. As a result of their greater stability in storage, improved targeting ability on disease cells, sustained drug release, and higher encapsulation ability, these are \ufb01nding widespread use as drug delivery systems [24, 25]. 486 Pradeep Kumar Ram et al", ". As a result of their greater stability in storage, improved targeting ability on disease cells, sustained drug release, and higher encapsulation ability, these are \ufb01nding widespread use as drug delivery systems [24, 25]. 486 Pradeep Kumar Ram et al. 6.4 Polymer-Lipid Hybrid Nanoparticles Liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles are the nanoparticles that have the most widespread acceptance among those that are now being employed for medication delivery. Although liposomes, which are lipid-based nanoparticles, exhibited excellent biocompat- ibility, they still experienced drug leakage and instability when they were stored. On the other hand, polymeric nanoparticles, which are polymer-based nanoparticles, were able to overcome this limitation by demonstrating high encapsulation/drug loading ability as well as stability. The fact that it demonstrated a lower level of biocom- patibility was, however, one of its own shortcomings. In order to overcome these de\ufb01ciencies and get an effective nanomaterial, researchers looked out and developed a hybrid system that will integrate the distinctive characteristics of the two classes of nano- particles. This hybrid system is referred to as polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticles (plhnps). With the help of this hybrid approach, parameters of biocompatibility, high storage stability, prolonged drug release, low drug leakage, tiny particle size, and high encap- sulation were ful\ufb01lled. As a result of the effectiveness of this tech- nology, it is currently being utilized for a variety of therapeutic", "objectives in addition to diagnostic applications. Plhnps is com- posed of three unique components, one of which is a polymeric core that is capable of ef\ufb01ciently encapsulating both hydrophilic and hydrophobic medicines. This is possible as a result of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic nature of the core and results in a high sustained release, a lipid shell that provides biocompatibility and high stability and a lipid-polyethylene glycol (PEG) that is found in the outer part and covered by a lipid layer to provide increased steric stability, prevent immune recognition, and increase time for circulation. There are many different applications for plhnps, including the administration of different chemotherapeutic drugs, the transfer of genes (sirna and DNA), as well as the applica- tion of plhnps in photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and ultrasound. A number of studies have demonstrated that they are suitable for use in imaging and alternative magnetic \ufb01elds (AMF), as well as in the administration of vaccinations and the activation of the immune system. Because of this, it has a wide range of applica- tions in the rapidly expanding medical environment [26]. Cell-Based Therapies and Drug Delivery: Advancements and Challenges 487 6.5 Self- microemulsifying Drug-Delivery System In recent times, there has been a signi\ufb01cant amount of interest in lipid-based pharmacological preparations, with a particular empha- sis on self-microemulsifying drug-delivery systems (SMEDDS). There are many challenges involved in the process of producing oral dosage forms of pharmaceuticals, one of the most challenging being inadequate bioavailability. Therefore, minimal hydrophilicity is a critical criterion for bioavailability in this context. This is due to the fact that medications canno", "roducing oral dosage forms of pharmaceuticals, one of the most challenging being inadequate bioavailability. Therefore, minimal hydrophilicity is a critical criterion for bioavailability in this context. This is due to the fact that medications cannot be absorbed through the gastro- intestinal tract (GIT) unless they are in solution form. A signi\ufb01cant number of chemical compounds that have pharmacological effects that are both remarkable and bene\ufb01cial have an issue with their solubility in water. Furthermore, about 30% of medicinal entities that are extensively sold and nearly 50% of novel medication com- pounds that are available for product manufacture are hydrophobic in nature, which means that they have low water solubility. The employment of a carrier system that is based on lipids in order to increase the bioavailability of drugs that are less water-soluble has signi\ufb01cantly increased in popularity over the past few years. The primary objective of this formulation is to ensure that the hydro- phobic components remain in solution throughout the entirety of the digestive system. Suspensions, dry emulsions, microemulsions, and self-emulsifying drug-delivery systems (SEDDS) are some of the different types of lipid-based carriers that are available. It has been reported in the past that SEDDS has the capability of incor- porating hydrophobic medicines [27]. Self-microemulsifying drug- delivery systems (SMEDDS) and self-nanoemulsifying drug-deliv- ery systems (SNEDDS) are two additional names that have been given to SEDDS after it has been revised. There are three different kinds of emulsions: water-in-oil, oil-in-water, and multiple", "er it has been revised. There are three different kinds of emulsions: water-in-oil, oil-in-water, and multiple", "emulsions or combinations of the two. In addition, traditional micro- or nanoemulsions behave differently from SMEDDS in that, after being ingested orally, they self-emulsify. There are two categories of emulsifying agents that are utilized in the production of microemulsions: surfactants (S) and co-surfactants (CoSs). Sur- factant, on the other hand, is primarily soluble in water, but CoS is primarily soluble in the oil phase where it functions. In order to bring the tension that is present between the two liquid phases down to the appropriate level that is necessary for the creation of a microemulsion, CoSs are absolutely necessary. For the creation of nanoemulsions with droplet sizes that are smaller than 100 nm, on the other hand, either mechanical or chemical energy is required. Despite the fact that nanoemulsions are considered to be kinetically stable due to the fact that their rate of destabilization is extremely low, their stability over a lengthy period of time (in months) is noteworthy. Consequently, it has been demonstrated that nanoe- mulsion globules are stable in a wide range of circumstances, including a variety of dilutions and temperatures, whereas micro- emulsions are primarily affected by parameters such as dilutions and temperature [28]. 488 Pradeep Kumar Ram et al. 6.6 In Situ Gel Drug Delivery System The primary objective of any drug delivery system is to alter the pharmacokinetic properties of the medication and to alter the distribution of the drug in the tissue in a manner that is signi\ufb01cant. One of the most cutting-edge methods of drug delivery is the in situ gel medicine administration, which has become increasingly popular. It is possible for the in situ gel drug delivery system to assist in the prolonged and regulated release of drugs, as w", " the most cutting-edge methods of drug delivery is the in situ gel medicine administration, which has become increasingly popular. It is possible for the in situ gel drug delivery system to assist in the prolonged and regulated release of drugs, as well as increased patient compliance and comfort. This is made possible by the unique property of transitioning from Sol to Gel. In the major- ity of instances, formulations that are normally in the form of a solution undergo a transformation into a gel form under speci\ufb01c physiological conditions prior to entering the body. In order to turn a solution into a gel form, a number of different stimuli, including changing the pH of the solution, modifying the temper- ature, and exchanging the solvent, are combined. Research has utilized a variety of administration methods, including but not limited to oral, nasal, injectable, vaginal, rectal ocular, intraperito- neal, and parenteral administration. There have been a great num- ber of polymeric approaches developed that are capable of delivering medications. A sol-gel transition takes place in these polymers whenever they are exposed to physiological stimuli when they come into contact with them. A wide range of natural and synthetic polymers are utilized in the production of in situ gel drug delivery systems. There are four processes that are known to produce the formation of in situ gel biomaterials. These processes are as follows: (1) variations in temperature and pH; (2) variations in the physical properties of the biomaterials, such as swelling and", "h as swelling and", "6.7 The Microelec- tromechanical Systems (MEMS) solvent exchange; (3) biochemical modi\ufb01cation, which includes enzymatic and chemical reactions; and (4) photo-polymerization. Cell-Based Therapies and Drug Delivery: Advancements and Challenges 489 MEMS technology has a wide range of applications in a variety of industries, including inkjet printing, motion detection, acceler- ometers, and actuators. Microfabrication techniques are utilized in the production of micro/nano-sized electromechanical and mechanical devices or implants [29, 30]. These devices are manu- factured through the utilization of this technology. It is interesting to note that the utilization of these techniques improves the ef\ufb01- ciency of these devices by enabling a signi\ufb01cant amount of control over the topography, microarchitecture, and proportions of the devices that are produced as a result. These MEMS-based devices can be designed using a wide variety of materials and processes, the most common of which are creative blends of different microma- chining techniques. These techniques include deposition, which is an addictive process, etching, which is a subtractive process, lithog- raphy, which is a patterning process, ink jetting, ion implantation, oxidation, and micromolding. MEMS technology is used to create miniaturized systems that are used as drug delivery systems. These systems are made up of a variety of materials, including silicon, glass, metals, and nitrides, as well as polymers, micropumps, sen- sors, microvalves, reservoirs, actuators, and high-performance computers. When compared to other conventional drug delivery methods, MEMS devices are known for their precision and multi- functionality, which are both widely documented. These unique components work together to give this precision and", "-performance computers. When compared to other conventional drug delivery methods, MEMS devices are known for their precision and multi- functionality, which are both widely documented. These unique components work together to give this precision and multi- functionality. Each of these characteristics function in a strategic manner; for example, actuators are primarily responsible for playing an important part in the process of drug release since they pressur- ize the drug reservoir in order to facilitate drug release. A single reservoir or many reservoirs can be used to store the drug(s), and they can be either singular or plural. The single-reservoir architec- ture is characterized by a port that is quite large and has the capacity to hold a single medication. Because of this, it is able to hold a signi\ufb01cantly bigger quantity of the medicine, and it is also suitable for use over an extended period of time because it can be re\ufb01lled. On the other hand, multi-reservoirs are made up of several ports that are integrated into the same substrate. These ports are designed to store pharmaceuticals in a separate manner, and as a result, these reservoirs may accommodate a wide variety of drugs. Due to the absence of re\ufb01lling mechanisms, however, they are not ideal for long-term use because they would necessitate repeated replacement surgeries. This makes them less suited for use. In addition, microvalves are utilized in order to perform functions such as controlling the \ufb02ow rate of \ufb02uids, sealing, and turning the delivery device on and off. During the fabrication process, silicon is frequently utilized as a substrate or structural material due to the", "nd off. During the fabrication process, silicon is frequently utilized as a substrate or structural material due to the", "desirable mechanical and electrical qualities that it possesses. For their part, sensors make use of mechanisms such as electrical radia- tion and mechanical, thermal, magnetic, or biological processes in order to monitor the \ufb02ow measurements of the \ufb02uid or gas that is being given. Therefore, the selection of each feature throughout the design process is one of the most important factors in deter- mining the overall functionality of the MEMS-based delivery sys- tem [31]. In order to facilitate the controlled and pulsatile release of pharmaceuticals that are encapsulated, devices that are based on MEMS play a crucial role in the delivery of drugs that are targeted and exact. Microchips are the most widely used type of MEMS technology that can be applied to the administration of drugs. Micro\ufb02uidic devices, and micropumps in particular, are the next most prevalent type. Micropumps, on the other hand, are notably restricted to the delivery of drug suspensions or solutions. Drug delivery systems that are manufactured using MEMS technologies offer a number of bene\ufb01ts that are not available with traditional delivery techniques. These bene\ufb01ts include improved performance, automation, precision, and ef\ufb01cacy. These advantages are made possible by the integration of their tiny sizes with components that serve many functions. Additionally, it contributes to the devices having characteristics that are less intrusive and discomfort- ing. The capacity of MEMS-based devices to preserve drug stability throughout encapsulation, as well as the ability to administer med- ications in a customizable and continuous manner, and the ability to permit the automated release of numerous pharmaceuticals from reservoirs are examples of their capabilities. In addition to this, it improves the bioavai", " ability to administer med- ications in a customizable and continuous manner, and the ability to permit the automated release of numerous pharmaceuticals from reservoirs are examples of their capabilities. In addition to this, it improves the bioavailability of medication and the localized release of medication, it is sustainable over a long period of time for treatments that require complex dosing, it has the ability to func- tion following sustained zero-order kinetics. MEMS-drug delivery devices, on the other hand, may present technical challenges. This is due to the fact that the incorporation of wireless electronics to remotely control and track the operation of the device, as well as the response of the patient, has also been projected to be capable of increasing the risks associated with device security, medical packag- ing, and regulatory complexities. In addition, surgical procedures would be necessary for the insertion and removal of these devices; items that are extremely stable would be required for long-term applications; and the technologies that are necessary for the pro- duction of these devices are rather expensive. 490 Pradeep Kumar Ram et al. 6.8 A Combined Drug Delivery Strategy It has been used to address the persistent problem of drug resis- tance in the \ufb01eld of medical therapy. Combination therapy is becoming increasingly practicable in today\u2019s medical world because of its wider target speci\ufb01city and complementarity, which contrib- ute to the enhancement of treatment ef\ufb01ciency and the enhance- ment of therapeutic results. The combined medication delivery", "therapeutic results. The combined medication delivery", "technique has been widely embraced in the \ufb01eld of cancer research and therapy as a means of overcoming the resistance that is caused by multiple drugs. It has been observed that the combination medication delivery technique reduces the therapeutic dosage as well as unpleasant responses, while on the other hand maintaining ef\ufb01ciency and a decrease in drug resistance. In a study that was carried out by Zamora-Mera and colleagues, the utilization of combination therapy for the treatment of magnetic hyperthermia was found to yield favorable outcomes. Chitosan nanoparticles (CSNPs) were ionically crosslinked with tripolyphosphate (TPP) salts before the experiment was carried out. The magnetic CSNPs were generated through the process of encapsulation with three distinct ferro\ufb02uid concentrations in addition to a constant concen- tration of 5-\ufb02uorouracil (5-FU). Normal cells, cell lines known as \ufb01broblasts (FHB), as well as cancer cells known as human glioblas- toma A-172 cells were utilized. In addition to exhibiting enhanced drug ef\ufb01cacy, prolonged half-lives, sustained drug release, and restricted immunogenicity and cytotoxicity, the cell-based therapy demonstrated these characteristics. The migratory or chemotaxic ability of the exploit cells was not affected by the combination of nanoparticles and exploit cells. As a consequence of this, the com- bined drug delivery technique is considered to be a promising approach in the \ufb01eld of medical therapy and substance research.

The system is designed to transport medica- tions in a speci\ufb01c order, which, in turn, results in an increase in the concentration of the drug as it is being delivered to the location where it is intended to be administered. The dosage of the medica- tion is decreased in order to limit the likelihood of experiencing adverse effects; nonetheless, the drug\u2019s effectiveness and potency are not affected in any way. This method makes use of a variety of different drug carriers, including but not limited to soluble poly- mers, biodegradable microsphere polymers, neutrophils, lipo- somes, micelles, and arti\ufb01cial cells (Table 1). In order to graft RGD-peptides onto the surface of the nanoparticles, which are an amino acid composed of Arg-Gly-Asp sequences, the nanoparticles were utilized. In order to ef\ufb01ciently target \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin, this action was taken. Using the RGD peptide resulted in the successful release of medications that were encapsulated, as well as the cellular uptake of pharmaceuticals by cancer cells. The cell was present in both cell lines. Wu and colleagues demonstrated that Fe3O4MgAl-LDH (lay- ered double hydroxide) nanoparticles with a size of around 230 nanometers exhibited a heightened release of methrotrexate (MTX).

According to the \ufb01ndings of the study, the cellular absorption was signi\ufb01cantly increased both in vitro and in vivo, and the tumor burden was signi\ufb01cantly reduced when compared to free medicines. 494 Pradeep Kumar Ram et al. Many drug delivery systems have been used successfully in recent times, and there has been a signi\ufb01cant advancement in the quest to deliver drugs from a variety of plant sources to their target sites for treatment within the body. Despite this, there are a great number of limitations and challenges associated with what these systems are capable of accomplishing in terms of treatment. Some of these challenges and limitations are discussed below. The small amount of literature that is currently available, as well as the varia- tion that exists within that material, presents a signi\ufb01cant obstacle to the development of drug delivery systems. The advancement of any research, and in this particular instance, nanomedicine approaches to therapy, is greatly aided by the vital knowledge that is provided by the literature. One of the most signi\ufb01cant challenges that has been encountered in the development of its applications in the medical \ufb01eld is the variance that exists between published research and the recorded characterization of experimental data that have been reported. Researchers have differing opinions on the effect", "ntered in the development of its applications in the medical \ufb01eld is the variance that exists between published research and the recorded characterization of experimental data that have been reported. Researchers have differing opinions on the effects of nanopar- ticles. While the advantages of nanoparticles are well-established, there is a lack of information regarding their safety, their interac- tions with non-speci\ufb01c proteins, and their behavior in organs that are not their intended targets. Every delivery system faces the challenge of addressing speci\ufb01c delivery complications. Ensuring the successful delivery of a speci\ufb01c target remains uncertain until it can effectively reach the intended location in adequate amounts. While it is true that the effectiveness of target-speci\ufb01c delivery hinges on its ability to reach the intended site in adequate amounts, there is no guarantee of its ef\ufb01cacy until this is achieved. This is crucial in order to reduce toxicity and achieve optimal treatment outcomes. Research is currently underway to explore the potential of lipid nanoparticles, such as micelles and liposomes, for targeted drug delivery. On the other hand, this approach may have a down- side as it could potentially decrease the nanoparticles\u2019 effectiveness by interfering with their interactions within the body. These inter- actions involve phagocytic absorption and hepatic \ufb01ltration, both of which can lead to the failure of target delivery. One major challenge faced by drug delivery systems is the potential toxicity of the", "particles involved in the delivery process. Certain nanomaterials have the potential to be hazardous. Carbon nanotubes, also referred to as CNTs, have been extensively utilized in various areas such as gene therapy, bioimaging, and medication delivery [35]. Although it has been found that carbon nanotubes can pass through cell membranes while carrying biomolecules, researchers have raised concerns about their properties, especially when it comes to using them for drug delivery. Studies have revealed the harmful effects of carbon nanotubes on various biological systems, including embryos, genes, the liver, the heart, neurons, and the immune system. While carbon nanotubes have shown promising results in their use, it is crucial to perform thorough toxicity testing to ensure their safety before they can be widely applied in the treatment of various conditions. Due to the impact they have, the use of these drugs has become a hindrance to their application in cancer treatment. Drug delivery systems face signi\ufb01cant challenges in terms of biocompatibility and acceptability. Biocompatibility refers to how well drugs interact with the body in certain situations, while acceptability refers to how well drugs are tolerated by the body without causing an immune response. This poses a problem as the body\u2019s response to biological materials greatly contrasts with its response to synthetic materials. Scientists have made signi\ufb01cant advancements in producing drugs that can function as both carriers and therapeutic agents. Furthermore, due to the intricate nature of the human system, there may be inherent obstacles to the effective- ness of these delivery systems. One such obstacle is the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which has a selectively permeable feature that hin- ders the achievement o", "the intricate nature of the human system, there may be inherent obstacles to the effective- ness of these delivery systems. One such obstacle is the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which has a selectively permeable feature that hin- ders the achievement of therapeutic drug concentration in brain tissues. The BBB acts as a barrier, preventing carrier particles from entering the brain and central nervous system, thereby rendering therapeutic agents ineffective in treating cerebral diseases. This inability to ef\ufb01ciently deliver and sustain intended drugs within the brain poses a signi\ufb01cant challenge. Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) are incredibly prevalent carriers within the body. They create immunoliposomes by attaching to the exteriors of liposomes, resulting in this outcome. Nevertheless, the capabilities of these immunoliposomes are constrained due to their potential to trigger an immune response. In addition, the body has minimal absorp- tion, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of these substances. Utilizing liposomes as a site-speci\ufb01c drug carrier poses a signi\ufb01cant challenge. These organs possess the remarkable capability to pro- cess nanoparticles as potential waste products, owing to their inher- ent ability to cleanse the body. The kidney and liver can also perform this function. In addition, the build-up of nanoparticles in these organs may result from their actions, leading to potential hindrances in drug delivery. Cell-Based Therapies and Drug Delivery: Advancements and Challenges 495", "496 Pradeep Kumar Ram et al. 7 Conclusion Cell therapy has emerged as a transformative frontier in modern medicine, holding substantial promise for treating a wide range of diseases across both human and veterinary medicine. With applica- tions that range from replacing damaged cells to enhancing immune responses, this innovative approach harnesses the power of living cells\u2014such as stem cells, immune cells, and genetically modi\ufb01ed cells\u2014to address conditions that conventional treatments often cannot. While immune cell-based therapies like CAR T-cell treatments have shown high ef\ufb01cacy, the \ufb01eld is still in its early stages, with most therapies undergoing clinical trials. Advances in gene editing, viral vector technology, and cell plasticity have signi\ufb01- cantly contributed to the development of targeted cell-based thera- pies, enabling novel approaches to tackle genetic disorders, cancers, and autoimmune diseases. However, substantial challenges remain, including the need for scalable manufacturing, regulatory approval, and further clinical evidence to ensure safety and ef\ufb01cacy. Continued collaboration between researchers and clinicians is essential to translate labora- tory \ufb01ndings into viable treatments. The growing success in veteri- nary applications also underscores the broad potential of cell therapy across species. Ultimately, as technological capabilities expand, cell therapy could become a cornerstone of personalized and regenerative medicine, revolutionizing the way we approach complex medical conditions.

Historically, traditional methods like oral and parenteral administration faced challenges with non-speci\ufb01c distribution and side effects. Modern advancements, such as controlled release and nanoscale delivery vehicles, have enhanced drug bioavailability and reduced adverse effects. The introduction of AI and ML has revolutionized drug delivery by enabling predictive modeling and personalized medicine.

The historical evolution of drug delivery has progressed from conventional methods, such as oral and parenteral administration, which primarily relied on passive diffusion and \ufb01rst-order kinetics for drug release [1]. These methods, while foundational, often Abhishek Pathak and Satya Pal Singh (eds.), Next-Generation Drug Delivery Systems, Methods in Pharmacology and Toxicology, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-4554-3_22, \u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025 499", "resulted in non-speci\ufb01c distribution, leading to suboptimal thera- peutic indices and signi\ufb01cant adverse effects. Modern advance- ments have shifted toward the development of sophisticated delivery systems, including controlled release formulations, site- speci\ufb01c targeting mechanisms, and nanoscale delivery vehicles [2]. These innovations leverage advanced materials and engineer- ing principles to achieve precise control over drug pharmacokinet- ics and pharmacodynamics, thereby enhancing the therapeutic index of administered drugs [3]. 500 Varun Asediya et al. Optimization of drug delivery is an inherently multidisciplinary challenge that encompasses several critical factors, including enhancing the bioavailability of poorly soluble or unstable drugs, ensuring the targeted delivery of therapeutics to speci\ufb01c tissues or cells, and developing robust controlled release systems that main- tain therapeutic drug concentrations within a narrow therapeutic window [4\u20136]. These systems are further required to exhibit high stability, biocompatibility, and patient acceptability to ensure clini- cal viability. For instance, enhancing bioavailability is particularly crucial for drugs with low aqueous solubility, where strategies such as the use of lipid-based formulations, polymeric nanoparticles, and cyclodextrin complexes are employed to increase solubilization and systemic absorption. Similarly, controlled release systems, such as hydrogels, biodegradable polymers, and liposomes, are designed to modulate drug release kinetics, thereby maintaining drug levels within the therapeutic window over extended periods. The integration of arti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into the domain of drug delivery has introduced a transformative approach to optimizing these syste", " maintaining drug levels within the therapeutic window over extended periods. The integration of arti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into the domain of drug delivery has introduced a transformative approach to optimizing these systems [7\u20139]. Initi- ally, AI applications within healthcare were restricted to elementary rule-based systems and descriptive analytics, with limited impact on drug delivery. However, with the advent of advanced algorithms and substantial increases in computational power, AI and ML have evolved to tackle complex biomedical challenges, including predic- tive modeling, image-based diagnostics, and high-dimensional data analysis. Notable advancements include the application of deep learning algorithms to medical imaging, enabling unprecedented precision in diagnostics, and the use of ML algorithms for pattern recognition and predictive analytics in clinical data. In the context of drug delivery optimization, AI and ML methodologies have become indispensable tools for analyzing large and complex datasets, such as those derived from clinical trials, electronic health records (EHRs), and real-world evidence. These technologies facilitate the development of predictive models that can accurately simulate pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmaco- dynamics (PD) within diverse patient populations. Such models enable the \ufb01ne-tuning of drug dosing regimens, optimizing the balance between therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy and toxicity. For instance, AI-driven PK/PD modeling can account for inter-individual", "variability in drug metabolism and clearance, thus allowing for personalized dosing strategies that minimize adverse effects while maximizing therapeutic bene\ufb01t. Arti\ufb01cial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Drug Delivery Optimization 501 Looking forward, the potential of AI and ML in drug delivery extends into several cutting-edge areas, including the realization of personalized medicine, where drug delivery systems are tailored based on individual genetic, phenotypic, and environmental fac- tors. This approach promises to revolutionize therapeutic strategies by moving beyond the traditional one-size-\ufb01ts-all paradigm to highly customized treatment regimens. Moreover, real-time patient monitoring facilitated by wearable devices and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies will enable continuous feedback loops, wherein drug delivery systems autonomously adjust dosage and release pro\ufb01les in response to real-time physiological data. The develop- ment of smart drug delivery systems\u2014capable of self-regulating based on patient-speci\ufb01c biomarkers\u2014represents a signi\ufb01cant leap toward truly adaptive and responsive therapeutic modalities. 2 Fundamentals of Arti\ufb01cial Intelligence and Machine Learning 2.1 Basics of AI and ML Arti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI) is a broad \ufb01eld within computer science dedicated to the creation of systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include cog- nitive functions such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, per- ception, and language understanding. AI systems are designed to simulate human cognitive processes, leveraging algorithms that enable machines to process information, draw inferences, and make decisions based on input data [10]. Machine learning (ML), a specialized sub\ufb01eld of AI, focuses on the devel", " designed to simulate human cognitive processes, leveraging algorithms that enable machines to process information, draw inferences, and make decisions based on input data [10]. Machine learning (ML), a specialized sub\ufb01eld of AI, focuses on the development of algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. Unlike traditional rule-based programming, where speci\ufb01c instructions are coded for each possible scenario, ML algorithms are designed to identify patterns and relationships within data, building mathematical mod- els that can generalize from the examples provided (referred to as training data). These models can then be used to make predictions or decisions when exposed to new, unseen data [11]. ML encompasses several techniques and approaches, ranging from simple linear regression to complex deep learning architec- tures. The primary goal of ML is to create systems that improve their performance on a given task with experience, without being explicitly programmed to handle all possible scenarios. This adapt- ability makes ML particularly powerful for tasks involving large and complex datasets, where traditional programming methods would be impractical or impossible. While AI includes a wide range of techniques, including rule- based systems, expert systems, and knowledge representation, ML", "speci\ufb01cally focuses on data-driven approaches. This distinction is crucial because, in many modern AI applications, ML serves as the underlying technology that powers the AI system\u2019s ability to learn and adapt over time. The advancement of ML, particularly with the advent of deep learning, has signi\ufb01cantly contributed to the resur- gence of AI, enabling breakthroughs in \ufb01elds such as computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics. 502 Varun Asediya et al. The relationship between AI and ML can be understood as hierarchical: AI represents the broader objective of creating intelli- gent systems, while ML is one of the most effective methods currently available to achieve this goal. As such, ML often serves as the engine driving AI applications, enabling machines to perform tasks that require complex, human-like decision-making capabilities [12]. 2.2 Key Techniques in ML Relevant to Drug Delivery Machine learning (ML) encompasses a diverse set of techniques, each with distinct methodologies and applications. In the context of drug delivery, these techniques enable the optimization of ther- apeutic interventions, tailoring treatments to individual patient needs, and advancing the design of innovative drug delivery sys- tems. Below are some of the key ML techniques particularly rele- vant to drug delivery: 2.2.1 Supervised Learning Supervised learning is one of the most widely used ML techniques, where a model is trained on a labelled dataset. Each training exam- ple in this dataset is associated with a known output label, such as a speci\ufb01c drug response or patient outcome. The model learns to map input features (such as patient demographics, genetic markers, and dosage levels) to the corresponding output labels through iterative adjustments. Once trained, the mo", "abel, such as a speci\ufb01c drug response or patient outcome. The model learns to map input features (such as patient demographics, genetic markers, and dosage levels) to the corresponding output labels through iterative adjustments. Once trained, the model can predict out- comes for new, unseen data based on the patterns it has learned [13]. In drug delivery, supervised learning plays a critical role in predicting drug ef\ufb01cacy and optimizing dosage regimens. For example, by training a model on clinical trial data, researchers can predict how a new patient might respond to a particular drug, allowing for personalized treatment plans that maximize therapeu- tic bene\ufb01t while minimizing adverse effects. Additionally, super- vised learning models can help identify patient subgroups that may bene\ufb01t from speci\ufb01c drug formulations, thereby enhancing the precision of drug delivery strategies [14, 15]. 2.2.2 Unsupervised Learning Unsupervised learning is a technique used when the dataset lacks labeled responses. Instead of predicting a speci\ufb01c output, unsuper- vised learning algorithms seek to identify underlying patterns, cor- relations, and structures within the data. This technique is particularly valuable for exploratory data analysis, where the goal is to uncover new insights without prede\ufb01ned hypotheses [16].", "Arti\ufb01cial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Drug Delivery Optimization 503 In the \ufb01eld of drug delivery, unsupervised learning is used to cluster patients with similar characteristics, such as genetic pro\ufb01les or treatment responses. By grouping similar patient pro\ufb01les, researchers can identify subpopulations that may respond differ- ently to certain therapies, enabling the development of targeted drug delivery systems. Moreover, unsupervised learning can reveal hidden patterns in drug response data, such as potential biomar- kers, which can be crucial for designing personalized medicine approaches [17]. 2.2.3 Reinforcement Learning Reinforcement learning (RL) is a dynamic ML technique where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment [18]. The agent performs actions and receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, which it uses to re\ufb01ne its decision-making process over time. Unlike supervised learning, where the correct output is provided during training, RL relies on trial and error to discover the best strategies for achieving a desired outcome [19]. In drug delivery, reinforcement learning can be applied to optimize drug administration schedules, particularly in complex treatment regimens where patient responses vary over time. For instance, RL algorithms can continuously learn and adapt to a patient\u2019s changing physiological conditions, adjusting the dosage and timing of drug administration to maintain optimal therapeutic levels. This approach is especially useful in managing chronic con- ditions, where long-term treatment requires ongoing adjustments based on patient feedback [20\u201323]. 2.2.4 Neural Networks and Deep Learning Neural networks, particularly deep learning, represent a specialized subset of ML characterized by their a", "con- ditions, where long-term treatment requires ongoing adjustments based on patient feedback [20\u201323]. 2.2.4 Neural Networks and Deep Learning Neural networks, particularly deep learning, represent a specialized subset of ML characterized by their ability to model complex, non-linear relationships in data [24]. A neural network consists of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process input data, extracting and combining features at different levels of abstraction. Deep learning, which involves networks with many layers, excels at identifying intricate patterns in large, high-dimensional datasets [25\u201328]. In drug delivery, deep learning has demonstrated signi\ufb01cant potential in several areas. For instance, it can analyze complex biological data to predict molecular interactions and drug-target binding af\ufb01nities, facilitating the design of novel drug delivery systems. Deep learning models are also used in image-based analy- sis, such as interpreting medical imaging data to monitor drug distribution and ef\ufb01cacy in real-time. Furthermore, deep learning can aid in the development of intelligent drug delivery platforms that autonomously adjust release pro\ufb01les based on patient-speci\ufb01c biomarkers and physiological data [29].", "504 Varun Asediya et al. 2.3 Evaluation Metrics in ML Models Evaluating the performance of machine learning (ML) models is a critical step in ensuring their effectiveness and reliability, particu- larly in high-stakes applications such as drug delivery optimization. Various evaluation metrics are employed to provide a comprehen- sive assessment of how well a model performs in predicting out- comes, with each metric offering unique insights into different aspects of the model\u2019s behavior. The selection of appropriate metrics depends on the speci\ufb01c objectives of the ML model and the characteristics of the data being analyzed [30, 31]. 2.3.1 Accuracy Accuracy is one of the most straightforward evaluation metrics and measures the proportion of correctly predicted instances out of the total instances. It provides a general sense of the model\u2019s perfor- mance by indicating the percentage of predictions that were cor- rect. While accuracy is useful in scenarios where the classes are well- balanced, it can be misleading in cases where there is a signi\ufb01cant class imbalance. For instance, in a dataset where the majority class constitutes 95% of the data, a model that always predicts the major- ity class would achieve 95% accuracy, despite being completely ineffective for the minority class. 2.3.2 Precision, Recall, and F1 Score To gain more nuanced insights, particularly in imbalanced datasets, precision, recall, and the F1 score are often used. Precision is the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions made by the model. It answers the question: \u201cOf all the instances that were predicted as positive, how many were actually positive?\u201d High precision indicates that the model has a low rate of false positives, making it particularly valuable in scenarios w", " by the model. It answers the question: \u201cOf all the instances that were predicted as positive, how many were actually positive?\u201d High precision indicates that the model has a low rate of false positives, making it particularly valuable in scenarios where false positives carry signi\ufb01cant consequences, such as in predicting adverse drug reactions. Recall (also known as sensitivity or true positive rate) measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances. It addresses the question: \u201cOf all the actual positive instances, how many did the model correctly identify?\u201d High recall is crucial in situations where missing a positive instance (false nega- tive) could lead to severe outcomes, such as failing to identify a patient who would bene\ufb01t from a speci\ufb01c drug therapy. F1 Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances the trade-off between these two mea- sures. The F1 score is particularly useful when there is an uneven class distribution, as it ensures that both false positives and false negatives are considered. A high F1 score indicates that the model", "performs well in both identifying true positives and minimizing false positives, making it a robust metric for evaluating models in complex medical applications. Arti\ufb01cial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Drug Delivery Optimization 505 2.3.3 ROC-AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic- Area Under the Curve) The ROC-AUC is a comprehensive evaluation metric that assesses the model\u2019s ability to discriminate between positive and negative classes across different threshold settings. The ROC curve plots the true positive rate (recall) against the false positive rate at various threshold levels, while the AUC (Area Under the Curve) quanti\ufb01es the overall ability of the model to distinguish between classes. An AUC value of 1.0 represents a perfect model, while an AUC of 0.5 indicates a model with no discriminative power [32]. In the context of drug delivery, the ROC-AUC metric is par- ticularly valuable because it provides insight into the trade-offs between sensitivity (recall) and speci\ufb01city (1\u2014false positive rate). This is crucial in optimizing therapeutic strategies where the cost of false positives and false negatives must be carefully balanced. For example, when developing a predictive model for drug ef\ufb01cacy, a high ROC-AUC score would indicate that the model is effective at distinguishing between patients who will and will not bene\ufb01t from a particular treatment, allowing for more precise and personalized therapeutic decisions. 3 AI and ML Applications in Drug Delivery Optimization The integration of arti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into drug delivery systems has revolutionized traditional approaches, offering innovative solutions that enhance the preci- sion, ef\ufb01ciency, and personalization of therapeutic interventions. These advanced technologies h", "AI) and machine learning (ML) into drug delivery systems has revolutionized traditional approaches, offering innovative solutions that enhance the preci- sion, ef\ufb01ciency, and personalization of therapeutic interventions. These advanced technologies have enabled the development of predictive models, personalized treatment regimens, and intelligent drug delivery systems, each contributing to optimized patient outcomes. 3.1 Predictive Modeling for Drug Behavior One of the most impactful applications of AI and ML in drug delivery is predictive modelling for drug behavior, which includes pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) modelling. These models use sophisticated AI and ML algorithms to predict the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of drugs within the body\u2014key processes that determine the drug\u2019s bioavailability and therapeutic effectiveness. By accurately model- ling these processes, AI-driven systems can predict the time course of drug action, optimizing dosing regimens to achieve the desired therapeutic effect while minimizing side effects [33]. AI and ML also facilitate the prediction of drug-drug interac- tions, which is crucial in polypharmacy scenarios where multiple drugs are administered simultaneously. By analyzing complex data- sets that include information on drug metabolism pathways, AI", "models can identify potential adverse interactions and adjust multi- drug therapies accordingly. This predictive capability enhances the safety and ef\ufb01cacy of treatment protocols, ensuring that patients receive the most appropriate combination of drugs based on their individual pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic pro\ufb01les [6, 34]. 506 Varun Asediya et al. 3.2 Personalization of Drug Delivery Personalized medicine is another critical area where AI and ML have made signi\ufb01cant contributions. AI-driven personalized drug delivery systems use patient-speci\ufb01c data\u2014such as age, weight, medical history, and genetic information\u2014to create tailored thera- peutic strategies that align with the unique characteristics of each patient. This approach contrasts with the traditional one-size-\ufb01ts- all model, which often fails to account for the variability in individ- ual responses to treatment [35, 36]. Pharmacogenomics, a \ufb01eld that combines pharmacology and genomics, is particularly enhanced by AI and ML. These technol- ogies enable the analysis of genetic data to predict how a patient will respond to a particular drug, allowing for more precise dosing and minimizing the risk of adverse effects. For instance, by considering genetic polymorphisms that affect drug metabolism, AI-driven systems can recommend dose adjustments that optimize therapeu- tic outcomes. This level of personalization ensures that treatments are not only effective but also safer, as they are speci\ufb01cally tailored to the patient\u2019s genetic makeup [37, 38]. 3.3 Smart Drug Delivery Systems AI-driven smart drug delivery systems represent a signi\ufb01cant advancement in the \ufb01eld, offering a dynamic and responsive approach to drug administration. These systems are designed to autonomously adjust drug release rates in real-time ba", "very Systems AI-driven smart drug delivery systems represent a signi\ufb01cant advancement in the \ufb01eld, offering a dynamic and responsive approach to drug administration. These systems are designed to autonomously adjust drug release rates in real-time based on con- tinuous monitoring of patient data. Sensors embedded within the delivery system or worn by the patient collect data on various physiological parameters, which are then analyzed by AI algorithms to determine the optimal drug release pro\ufb01le [39]. For example, in the management of chronic diseases such as diabetes or hypertension, AI-driven systems can adjust the release of medication based on real-time glucose levels or blood pressure readings. This continuous feedback loop ensures that therapeutic levels are maintained, reducing the risk of complications associated with under- or over-dosing. Additionally, these systems can detect changes in the patient\u2019s condition and provide timely interventions, such as adjusting the dosage or alerting healthcare providers, thereby improving overall disease management [40]. The integration of AI and ML into smart drug delivery systems also facilitates the development of adaptive treatment protocols. These protocols are capable of evolving based on the patient\u2019s response to therapy, leading to a more personalized and effective treatment experience. The ability of AI to process vast amounts of data in real-time and to learn from previous outcomes makes these", "systems highly responsive and precise, offering a signi\ufb01cant improvement over traditional drug delivery method [41]. Arti\ufb01cial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Drug Delivery Optimization 507 4 Techniques and Tools The application of machine learning (ML) algorithms in drug delivery optimization is fundamental to unlocking the full potential of arti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI) in healthcare. By employing sophisti- cated algorithms and leveraging advanced computational tools, researchers and clinicians can develop highly precise and persona- lized drug delivery systems that improve patient outcomes and enhance the ef\ufb01cacy of therapeutic interventions. Below, we explore key ML algorithms, data sources, and computational tools that are essential for optimizing drug delivery. 4.1 Key Machine Learning Algorithms 4.1.1 Support Vector Machines (SVM) Support vector machines (SVM) are powerful supervised learning algorithms used for classi\ufb01cation and regression tasks. SVMs oper- ate by identifying the optimal hyperplane that separates different classes of data, maximizing the margin between the classes. This makes SVMs particularly effective in analyzing complex, high- dimensional datasets, which are common in drug delivery studies. In drug delivery optimization, SVMs are employed to predict drug ef\ufb01cacy, model patient responses, and classify outcomes based on various input features, such as genetic markers, drug properties, and patient demographics. Their robustness and ability to handle non-linear relationships make SVMs a valuable tool in personalized medicine. 4.1.2 Random Forests Random forests are ensemble learning algorithms that combine the predictions of multiple decision trees to enhance accuracy and reduce over\ufb01tting. During training, multiple decision trees are constru", "ool in personalized medicine. 4.1.2 Random Forests Random forests are ensemble learning algorithms that combine the predictions of multiple decision trees to enhance accuracy and reduce over\ufb01tting. During training, multiple decision trees are constructed, each based on a random subset of the data and fea- tures. The \ufb01nal prediction is determined by aggregating the results of these individual trees\u2014either by majority vote in classi\ufb01cation tasks or by averaging in regression tasks. Random forests are highly effective in handling large, high-dimensional datasets and are par- ticularly useful for predicting drug-drug interactions, patient- speci\ufb01c responses, and potential side effects. Their ability to provide feature importance rankings also aids in identifying the most signif- icant variables in\ufb02uencing drug ef\ufb01cacy and safety. 4.1.3 Neural Networks and Deep Learning Neural networks, especially deep learning models, are at the fore- front of modern AI applications in drug delivery. These models consist of layers of interconnected neurons that process input data through weighted connections, allowing the network to learn com- plex patterns and relationships. Deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, are essential for building and training", "these models. In drug delivery, deep learning is applied to tasks such as image recognition for medical diagnostics, predictive ana- lytics for drug behavior, and the design of novel drug delivery systems. The capacity of deep learning models to handle large, unstructured datasets, such as medical images and genomic data, makes them indispensable tools for advancing precision medicine. 508 Varun Asediya et al. 4.2 Data Sources and Management The success of AI and ML applications in drug delivery heavily depends on the availability and quality of data. Two primary sources of data are critical for training and validating ML models. 4.2.1 Clinical Trial Data Clinical trial data are considered the gold standard for developing and validating predictive models in drug delivery. These datasets provide high-quality, controlled information on drug ef\ufb01cacy, side effects, pharmacokinetics, and patient outcomes. The structured nature of clinical trial data allows for rigorous testing of ML mod- els, ensuring that the predictions generated are reliable and clini- cally relevant. Furthermore, clinical trial data can be used to simulate various scenarios, helping researchers understand the potential impact of different drug delivery strategies. 4.2.2 Real-World Data Real-world data, derived from electronic health records (EHRs), wearable devices, and patient-reported outcomes, offer a wealth of information that re\ufb02ects the day-to-day variability in patient responses and treatment adherence. Unlike clinical trial data, real- world data capture the complexities of everyday clinical practice, including patient comorbidities, lifestyle factors, and medication adherence. The integration of real-world data with clinical trial data enhances the robustness and generalizability of ML models, e", "ure the complexities of everyday clinical practice, including patient comorbidities, lifestyle factors, and medication adherence. The integration of real-world data with clinical trial data enhances the robustness and generalizability of ML models, enabling more accurate and personalized predictions. This integra- tion allows for the development of adaptive drug delivery systems that can respond to real-time changes in patient conditions. 4.3 Computational Tools and Platforms The development and deployment of sophisticated AI-driven drug delivery systems require a robust computational infrastructure. Key considerations include the choice of software frameworks, hard- ware resources, and cloud-based platforms. 4.3.1 Software Frameworks and Libraries ML frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn provide the necessary tools for developing, training, and deploying ML models. TensorFlow and PyTorch, in particular, are widely used for deep learning applications, offering extensive libraries and tools for building complex neural networks. Scikit-learn is favored for its simplicity and versatility in implementing a wide range of ML algorithms, including SVMs and random forests. These frameworks support the entire ML pipeline, from data pre- processing to model evaluation, and are essential for researchers and developers working on drug delivery optimization [42, 43].", "Arti\ufb01cial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Drug Delivery Optimization 509 4.3.2 Hardware Resources The computational demands of deep learning models, especially those involving large datasets and complex architectures, necessi- tate the use of specialized hardware. Graphics processing units (GPUs) and tensor processing units (TPUs) are critical for accel- erating the training of deep learning models, signi\ufb01cantly reducing the time required to develop effective AI-driven systems. These hardware resources enable parallel processing, allowing for the simultaneous computation of multiple operations, which is essen- tial for handling the intensive processing requirements of modern ML models. 4.3.3 Cloud Computing and Distributed Systems Cloud computing platforms, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, offer scalable solutions for data storage, processing, and model training. These platforms pro- vide the infrastructure needed to manage large datasets and per- form computationally intensive tasks, enabling researchers and clinicians to leverage advanced AI capabilities without the con- straints of local hardware limitations. Cloud-based solutions also support collaborative research, allowing teams to share data, mod- els, and results across geographical locations. Additionally, distributed systems facilitate the deployment of AI-driven drug delivery systems in real-world clinical settings, enabling real-time data processing and decision-making. 5 Ethical, Regulatory, and Practical Considerations 5.1 Ethical Implications of AI in Drug Delivery The integration of arti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI) into drug delivery systems introduces a range of ethical considerations that must be carefully addressed to ensure the responsible and equitable use of the", "5.1 Ethical Implications of AI in Drug Delivery The integration of arti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI) into drug delivery systems introduces a range of ethical considerations that must be carefully addressed to ensure the responsible and equitable use of these technologies [44\u201346]. 5.1.1 Bias and Fairness in AI Algorithms One of the foremost ethical concerns is the potential for bias within AI algorithms. Since AI models are often trained on historical data, there is a signi\ufb01cant risk that they may inherit and even exacerbate existing biases present in that data. These biases could lead to unequal treatment outcomes, disproportionately affecting certain patient populations, particularly those who are underrepresented in the training datasets [47\u201350]. For example, if an AI model is predominantly trained on data from a speci\ufb01c demographic, its predictions and recommendations may not be as accurate or effective for patients outside that group. This could result in suboptimal drug delivery strategies for minority populations, perpetuating health disparities. Addressing this issue requires the use of diverse and representative datasets during the training phase, as well as ongoing monitoring and validation to identify and mitigate any biases that emerge. Researchers and developers must prioritize fairness by continuously re\ufb01ning", "algorithms to ensure equitable treatment outcomes for all patient groups. 510 Varun Asediya et al. 5.1.2 Patient Privacy and Data Security The use of AI in drug delivery also raises signi\ufb01cant concerns about patient privacy and data security. AI systems rely on vast amounts of sensitive personal health data to make accurate predictions and recommendations. This data often includes detailed information about a patient\u2019s medical history, genetic information, and real- time health metrics, all of which are highly con\ufb01dential [51]. To protect patient privacy, it is essential to implement robust data protection measures. This includes encrypting data both at rest and in transit, ensuring that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive information, and using anonymization techniques where possible to minimize the risk of identi\ufb01cation. Compliance with data protection regulations, such as the General Data Protec- tion Regulation (GDPR) in Europe and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the United States, is crucial to maintaining patient trust and safeguarding their privacy. Moreover, AI developers and healthcare providers must estab- lish transparent data governance frameworks that outline how patient data will be collected, stored, used, and shared. Patients should be informed about how their data will be used in AI-driven drug delivery systems and should have the opportunity to provide informed consent. This transparency is essential not only for ethical compliance but also for fostering patient trust in AI technologies. 5.1.3 Autonomy and Consent Another ethical consideration is the potential impact of AI on patient autonomy. AI-driven drug delivery systems, especially those that operate autonomously, might reduce the patient\u2019s ability", "ient trust in AI technologies. 5.1.3 Autonomy and Consent Another ethical consideration is the potential impact of AI on patient autonomy. AI-driven drug delivery systems, especially those that operate autonomously, might reduce the patient\u2019s ability to make informed decisions about their treatment. While these systems are designed to optimize therapeutic outcomes, it is crucial that patients retain the right to understand and consent to the treatment decisions made by AI. Healthcare providers must ensure that AI systems are used to complement, not replace, the patient-provider relationship. Patients should be fully informed about how AI will in\ufb02uence their treatment and should have the opportunity to discuss any recommendations made by the system with their healthcare pro- vider. Informed consent must remain a cornerstone of patient care, even as AI plays a more signi\ufb01cant role in drug delivery. 5.1.4 Accountability and Transparency The complexity of AI algorithms can make it challenging to under- stand how decisions are made, raising concerns about accountabil- ity. In the event of an adverse outcome, it may be dif\ufb01cult to determine whether the fault lies with the AI system, the data it was trained on, or the healthcare provider\u2019s interpretation of the AI\u2019s recommendations.", "Arti\ufb01cial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Drug Delivery Optimization 511 To address this, AI systems used in drug delivery should be designed with transparency in mind. This includes creating explain- able AI (XAI) models that provide clear, interpretable insights into how decisions are made. Healthcare providers should also be trained to understand the limitations of AI and how to critically assess its recommendations. Establishing clear lines of accountabil- ity is essential for maintaining trust and ensuring that patients receive the highest standard of care. 5.2 Regulatory Landscape The regulatory landscape for arti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI) in drug delivery is rapidly evolving as regulatory bodies recognize the transformative potential of AI-driven technologies and the unique challenges they present. As AI continues to advance, regulators are tasked with developing and adapting frameworks that ensure the safety, ef\ufb01cacy, and ethical use of AI in healthcare, particularly in the sensitive and high-stakes area of drug delivery. 5.2.1 Current Regulatory Frameworks Regulatory agencies such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) have begun to establish guidelines and frameworks speci\ufb01cally designed to address the integration of AI into medical devices and drug delivery systems [52\u201357]. These frameworks emphasize several key areas: (a) Transparency AI systems used in drug delivery must be transparent, meaning that the algorithms and decision-making processes should be understandable to both regulators and healthcare providers. This is critical to ensure that the systems are functioning as intended and that their recommendations can be trusted by clinicians. (b) Validation Before AI-driven drug delivery systems can be approve", "ble to both regulators and healthcare providers. This is critical to ensure that the systems are functioning as intended and that their recommendations can be trusted by clinicians. (b) Validation Before AI-driven drug delivery systems can be approved for clinical use, they must undergo rigorous validation processes. This involves demonstrating that the AI models are accurate, reliable, and capable of performing as expected in real-world settings. Vali- dation includes pre-market testing, clinical trials, and other forms of evaluation to ensure that the systems are safe and effective for patient care. (c) Post-market Surveillance Once AI-driven systems are deployed, continuous monitoring is required to identify any potential issues that may arise during their use. This post-market surveillance is crucial for detecting rare or long-term adverse effects that might not have been evident during initial testing. Regulators require manufacturers to maintain systems for ongoing data collection and reporting to ensure that any emerging risks are promptly addressed.", "512 Varun Asediya et al. 5.3 Challenges and Future Directions The rapid pace of AI development presents several challenges for regulators. Traditional regulatory pathways, which were designed for static medical devices and drugs, may not be well-suited to the dynamic and adaptive nature of AI technologies. AI systems, par- ticularly those that incorporate continuous learning algorithms, can evolve over time based on new data, necessitating a regulatory approach that can accommodate these changes without compromising safety. 5.3.1 Algorithm Transparency and Explainability One of the key challenges is ensuring algorithm transparency and explainability. Many AI systems, especially those based on deep learning, operate as \u201cblack boxes,\u201d where the decision-making process is not easily interpretable. Regulators are increasingly focused on requiring AI systems to provide explainable outputs that clinicians and patients can understand. This transparency is essential not only for regulatory approval but also for gaining the trust of end-users. 5.3.2 Model Validation and Continuous Learning Another signi\ufb01cant regulatory challenge is model validation, par- ticularly for AI systems that are designed to continuously learn and adapt. Traditional validation methods may be insuf\ufb01cient for these systems, as the model\u2019s behavior could change after deployment. Regulators are exploring new approaches to validation that account for the dynamic nature of AI, including the possibility of requiring periodic re-validation or real-time validation mechanisms. 5.3.3 Streamlining Approval Processes To keep pace with the rapid development of AI technologies, regulators are also considering ways to streamline the approval process for AI-driven drug delivery systems. This could involve creating accele", "hanisms. 5.3.3 Streamlining Approval Processes To keep pace with the rapid development of AI technologies, regulators are also considering ways to streamline the approval process for AI-driven drug delivery systems. This could involve creating accelerated pathways for approval, particularly for systems that demonstrate clear bene\ufb01ts over existing technologies. How- ever, any such streamlining must be balanced with the need to maintain rigorous safety standards, ensuring that patient safety is never compromised. 5.3.4 Emerging Regulatory Trends Looking forward, the regulatory landscape for AI in drug delivery is likely to become more specialized and nuanced. Future regulations may include: (a) Standards for Continuous Learning Systems: As continuous learning becomes more common in AI systems, regulators will need to establish standards for how these systems should be monitored and validated over time. (b) Algorithmic Audits: Regular audits of AI algorithms may become a standard requirement, ensuring that they remain free from bias and continue to operate as intended.", "Arti\ufb01cial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Drug Delivery Optimization 513 (c) Harmonization of International Standards: As AI-driven drug delivery systems become global, there will be a growing need for harmonized international regulatory standards to ensure consistency and safety across different regions. 5.4 Practical Challenges and Solutions The integration of arti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI) into clinical work\ufb02ows for drug delivery optimization holds tremendous promise, but it also presents a series of practical challenges that must be overcome to fully realize its bene\ufb01ts. Addressing these challenges is crucial for the successful adoption and effective use of AI-driven technologies in healthcare settings. Challenge 1: Seamless Integration with Existing Healthcare Systems One of the most signi\ufb01cant challenges in deploying AI for drug delivery is ensuring seamless integration with existing healthcare systems, particularly electronic health records (EHRs). AI systems must be able to communicate and exchange data with EHRs ef\ufb01- ciently to function effectively. This interoperability is essential for AI algorithms to access and analyze patient data in real-time, enabling personalized drug delivery recommendations. Solution: Interoperability and User-Friendly Interfaces To address the challenge of integration, it is necessary to develop AI systems that are interoperable with a wide range of EHR platforms. This requires the adoption of standardized data formats and com- munication protocols, such as HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Inter- operability Resources), which facilitate data exchange between different healthcare systems. Additionally, creating user-friendly interfaces is critical for ensuring that healthcare professionals can easily interact with AI tools. These interface", "er- operability Resources), which facilitate data exchange between different healthcare systems. Additionally, creating user-friendly interfaces is critical for ensuring that healthcare professionals can easily interact with AI tools. These interfaces should be designed with the end-user in mind, offering intuitive navigation, clear visualizations, and actionable insights that can be seamlessly incorporated into clinical work\ufb02ows. Collaborating with healthcare providers during the design phase can help ensure that AI systems are tailored to meet the speci\ufb01c needs of clinical environments. Challenge 2: Education and Training of Healthcare Professionals Another practical challenge is the education and training of health- care professionals on the use of AI-driven tools. Clinicians, nurses, and other healthcare staff need to understand how these technolo- gies work, their bene\ufb01ts, and their potential limitations. Without adequate training, there is a risk of misuse or underutilization of AI tools, which could lead to suboptimal patient outcomes.", "514 Varun Asediya et al. Solution: Comprehensive Training Programs To overcome this challenge, it is essential to develop and implement comprehensive training programs that educate healthcare profes- sionals on the fundamentals of AI, its applications in drug delivery, and the speci\ufb01c tools they will be using. These programs should cover both the technical aspects of AI and its practical implications in patient care. Continuous education and support should be provided to help healthcare professionals stay updated on the latest advancements in AI and to address any questions or concerns that may arise during use. Simulation-based training, workshops, and hands-on demonstrations can be particularly effective in building con\ufb01dence and competence in using AI tools. Challenge 3: Resistance to Adoption Resistance to the adoption of AI technologies is another practical challenge. Healthcare professionals may be hesitant to rely on AI for critical decision-making processes due to concerns about reli- ability, loss of control, or the potential for errors. This resistance can slow down the implementation of AI-driven drug delivery systems and hinder their potential impact. Solution: Building Trust Through Collaboration and Transparency Building trust in AI technologies requires collaboration between AI developers, healthcare providers, and regulators. Transparency in how AI algorithms work, how decisions are made, and how data is used is crucial for gaining the trust of healthcare professionals. AI systems should be designed to complement, rather than replace, human decision-making, with clear explanations provided for each recommendation or prediction made by the AI. Involving health- care professionals in the development and validation process can also help address concerns and", "ment, rather than replace, human decision-making, with clear explanations provided for each recommendation or prediction made by the AI. Involving health- care professionals in the development and validation process can also help address concerns and foster a sense of ownership over the technology. Additionally, pilot programs and phased rollouts can allow clinicians to gradually familiarize themselves with AI tools, leading to greater acceptance and integration into routine practice. Challenge 4: Data Quality and Availability The effectiveness of AI in drug delivery depends heavily on the quality and availability of data. Inconsistent, incomplete, or biased data can lead to inaccurate predictions and suboptimal recommen- dations. Ensuring that AI systems have access to high-quality, comprehensive data is a critical challenge that must be addressed. Solution: Data Standardization and Quality Control To ensure data quality, healthcare organizations should implement standardized data collection and management practices. This includes establishing protocols for data entry, ensuring consistency", "across different data sources, and implementing robust quality control measures to identify and correct errors. Data standardiza- tion can also be facilitated by the adoption of common coding systems and terminologies, such as ICD-10 and SNOMED CT, which ensure that data is uniformly categorized and can be easily interpreted by AI algorithms. Additionally, AI developers should focus on creating models that are capable of handling imperfect data, using techniques such as data augmentation and imputation to improve the robustness of predictions.

This could signi\ufb01cantly accel- erate the processing of large datasets and the training of AI models, making it possible to analyze intricate patterns in biological data and optimize drug delivery systems in real-time. 6.1.2 Integration with Cutting-Edge Technologies The integration of AI with other emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain, is opening new ave- nues for innovation in drug delivery. IoT devices, including wear- able sensors and smart implants, can continuously collect real-time patient data, such as glucose levels, heart rate, and activity patterns. AI models can analyze this data to make dynamic adjustments to drug delivery protocols, ensuring that patients receive the right dose at the right time. Blockchain technology, with its decentralized and secure framework, offers a robust solution for managing patient data. By ensuring the integrity and privacy of health data, blockchain can foster greater trust and compliance in AI-driven healthcare systems. This is particularly important in personalized medicine, where the protection of sensitive patient information is paramount.", "516 Varun Asediya et al. 6.1.3 Personalized Drug Delivery Systems Another trend is the advancement of personalized drug delivery systems that leverage AI to tailor treatments based on individual patient pro\ufb01les. These systems are becoming increasingly capable of considering a wide array of factors, including genetic, phenotypic, and environmental data, to optimize drug dosing and timing. This level of personalization is expected to signi\ufb01cantly improve thera- peutic outcomes by reducing adverse effects and enhancing drug ef\ufb01cacy. 6.2 Potential Disruptions and Transformations AI is on the cusp of bringing about signi\ufb01cant disruptions and transformations in drug discovery, development, and delivery, which could fundamentally change the pharmaceutical industry. 6.2.1 Streamlining Drug Discovery AI-driven approaches are already beginning to streamline the drug discovery process. Traditional drug discovery methods are often time-consuming and expensive, with a high rate of failure. AI, however, can analyze vast amounts of biological and chemical data to identify potential drug candidates more quickly and ef\ufb01- ciently. Machine learning models can predict the ef\ufb01cacy, toxicity, and safety pro\ufb01les of new compounds, enabling researchers to prioritize the most promising candidates for further development. This could drastically reduce the time and cost involved in bringing new drugs to market. 6.2.2 Real-Time Health Monitoring and Intervention The combination of AI with real-time health monitoring technol- ogies is another area of transformation. Wearable devices and sen- sors can continuously monitor patient health, collecting data that AI models can use to predict potential health issues before they become critical. For example, AI could alert a patient to a potential adverse r", "nsformation. Wearable devices and sen- sors can continuously monitor patient health, collecting data that AI models can use to predict potential health issues before they become critical. For example, AI could alert a patient to a potential adverse reaction to a medication or suggest an adjustment in dosage based on real-time physiological data. This proactive approach to healthcare could improve patient outcomes by preventing compli- cations and ensuring that treatments are always optimized to the patient\u2019s current condition. 6.2.3 Autonomous Drug Delivery Systems AI is also enabling the development of autonomous drug delivery systems that can operate with minimal human intervention. These systems use AI algorithms to continuously adjust drug delivery based on feedback from sensors, ensuring that therapeutic levels are maintained without the need for constant monitoring by healthcare providers. This could be particularly bene\ufb01cial for man- aging chronic conditions, where consistent and precise medication administration is crucial. 6.3 Vision for the Future The long-term implications of AI and ML for healthcare, and particularly for drug delivery, are profound and far-reaching. As these technologies continue to evolve, they are expected to make", "healthcare more personalized, ef\ufb01cient, and responsive to individ- ual patient needs. Arti\ufb01cial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Drug Delivery Optimization 517 6.3.1 Integration into Clinical Practice The vision for the future includes a healthcare ecosystem where AI seamlessly integrates with clinical practice, guiding decisions with precision and improving patient care. In this ecosystem, AI-driven drug delivery systems will become increasingly smart and autono- mous, capable of making real-time adjustments based on continu- ous patient data. This integration will not only enhance the ef\ufb01cacy of treatments but also reduce the likelihood of adverse effects, thereby improving patient compliance and overall satisfaction with their treatment regimens. 6.3.2 Proactive and Adaptive Healthcare Systems AI and ML are set to drive a shift toward proactive and adaptive healthcare systems that can respond dynamically to changes in patient health. By continuously monitoring and analyzing patient data, these systems will be able to anticipate potential health issues and intervene early, preventing complications and optimizing treat- ment outcomes. This approach represents a move away from the reactive, one-size-\ufb01ts-all model of healthcare toward a more perso- nalized and anticipatory approach. 6.3.3 Convergence of Technologies Ultimately, the convergence of AI, ML, and other advanced tech- nologies such as IoT, blockchain, and quantum computing will lead to a paradigm shift in how drugs are developed, delivered, and monitored. This convergence will enable the creation of a more connected and intelligent healthcare system that is capable of adapting to the unique needs of each patient in real-time.

Simran Kour, Shivali Khandelwal, Roshni, and Vishal Yadav Abstract In vitro models for drug delivery systems play a crucial role in pharmaceutical research by providing controlled environments to study the behavior and ef\ufb01cacy of drug formulations. These models typically involve simulated biological systems or tissues that allow researchers to assess drug release kinetics, stability, and interactions with biological barriers such as cell membranes. By mimicking physiological conditions in a controlled manner, in vitro models help in optimizing drug formulations for improved delivery ef\ufb01ciency and therapeutic outcomes. They are instrumental in screening potential drug candidates, assessing toxicity levels, and understanding mechanisms of drug absorption and distribution within the body. Overall, in vitro models serve as indispensable tools in developing and evaluating novel drug delivery systems, bridging the gap between early-stage research and clinical applications. This comprehensive review explores various in vitro models, including cell cultures, tissue explants, and organ-on-a-chip technologies, highlighting their applications, advantages, limitations, and prospects. Through understanding these models, research- ers can enhance the design and ef\ufb01cacy of DDS, ultimately improving therapeutic outcomes. Key words Biomimicry, Cell cultures, Drug delivery, Tissue explants 1 Introduction The evolution of drug delivery systems (DDS) marks a transforma- tive era in pharmaceutical sciences.

A critical component in the development of these systems is the utilization of in vitro models, which serve as pivotal tools in the preclinical phase of drug discov- ery and development. These models offer a controlled and replica- ble environment to study various aspects of drug behavior, including release kinetics, absorption, metabolism, and cellular interactions. By providing insights into the mechanisms of action and potential ef\ufb01cacy of therapeutic agents, vitro models facilitate the optimization of drug formulations and the prediction of in vivo outcomes. These models typically involve cultured cells, tissues, or organotypic constructs under controlled laboratory conditions [1]. Their primary objective is to simulate human physiological conditions and investigate interactions between drug delivery Abhishek Pathak and Satya Pal Singh (eds.), Next-Generation Drug Delivery Systems, Methods in Pharmacology and Toxicology, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-4554-3_23, \u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025 523", "systems and biological entities such as cells, tissues, and organs [2]. Recent advancements in drug delivery systems (DDS) are pivotal in pharmaceutical and biomedical research, aiming to improve therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy, safety, and patient compliance by precisely controlling drug release kinetics, localization, and dura- tion of action within the body. Conventional drug administration methods, such as oral ingestion and intravenous injection, often face challenges like poor bioavailability, rapid clearance, and off-target effects. Advanced DDS technologies, including nanopar- ticles, liposomes, hydrogels, and microneedles, are designed to overcome these limitations through innovative materials and deliv- ery approaches [3, 4]. In vitro models are indispensable in the early stages of drug development for several reasons. Firstly, they signi\ufb01- cantly reduce the reliance on animal testing, aligning with ethical considerations and regulatory guidelines aimed at minimizing ani- mal use. Secondly, these models enable high-throughput screening of numerous drug formulations, thereby expediting the evaluation process and allowing for rapid optimization. Thirdly, the controlled environment of in vitro systems permits the precise manipulation of experimental variables, leading to reproducible and consistent results. Lastly, in vitro models provide detailed mechanistic insights into drug-cell interactions, which are often challenging to elucidate in vivo due to the complexity of the whole organism. These models offer researchers the ability to investigate drug release dynamics, cellular uptake mechanisms, cytotoxicity pro\ufb01les, and modes of action without the ethical and logistical complexities associated with in vivo studies [5]. By tailoring these models to replicate speci\ufb01c physiolo", "y to investigate drug release dynamics, cellular uptake mechanisms, cytotoxicity pro\ufb01les, and modes of action without the ethical and logistical complexities associated with in vivo studies [5]. By tailoring these models to replicate speci\ufb01c physiological conditions, researchers gain valuable insights into optimizing DDS design and translating these advancements into clinical applications [6]. The evolution of in vitro models has paralleled advances in tissue engineering and microfabrication tech- nologies. Traditional two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures, although foundational, often fail to fully replicate the complex three- dimensional (3D) architecture and microenvironment of human tissues [7]. This limitation has led to the development of more sophisticated models such as 3D cell cultures, organoids, and micro\ufb02uidic \u201corgan-on-a-chip\u201d platforms, which provide a more physiologically relevant context for studying drug delivery [8]. 524 S. Simran Kour et al. 2 Importance of In Vitro Models in Drug Delivery The signi\ufb01cance of in vitro models in drug delivery research cannot be overstated. These models offer a myriad of advantages that make them invaluable tools in the drug development process: 1.

By providing prelimi- nary data on drug ef\ufb01cacy and safety, these models can re\ufb01ne and reduce subsequent animal studies. 2. High-Throughput Screening: In vitro models enable the rapid screening of large numbers of drug candidates. This high- throughput capability is essential for identifying promising compounds early in the drug development process, thereby saving time and resources. 3. Controlled Environment: In vitro systems offer a highly con- trolled experimental environment, allowing researchers to manipulate speci\ufb01c variables such as drug concentration, expo- sure time, and environmental conditions. This control leads to more precise and reproducible results compared to in vivo studies. 4. Mechanistic Insights: In vitro models facilitate detailed mecha- nistic studies of drug-cell interactions. Researchers can investi- gate cellular uptake, intracellular traf\ufb01cking, metabolic pathways, and cytotoxic effects in a more straightforward and controlled manner than is possible in vivo. 5. Cost-Effectiveness: Conducting in vitro studies is generally less expensive than in vivo studies. The reduced cost, coupled with the ability to perform high-throughput screening, makes in vitro models a cost-effective option in the early stages of drug development [9, 10]. 3 Types of In Vitro Models 3.1 Cell Culture Models Cell culture models are among the most widely used in vitro sys- tems due to their simplicity, versatility, and relevance to human biology.

Simran Kour et al. 3.1.1 Monolayer Cell Cultures Monolayer cell cultures involve the growth of cells in a single layer on a substrate. In these cultures, cells are grown on \ufb02at surfaces, typically within plastic or glass dishes, where they adhere and pro- liferate to form a single layer. These models are extensively used to study drug absorption, permeability, and cytotoxicity [11]. Com- monly used cell lines include: \u2022 Caco-2 Cells: Derived from human colorectal adenocarcinoma, Caco-2 cells differentiate to form tight junctions and microvilli, resembling the intestinal epithelium. They are extensively used to study oral drug absorption and permeability. Caco-2 assays are valuable for predicting the intestinal absorption of orally administered drugs and for studying the in\ufb02uence of ef\ufb02ux transporters such as P-glycoprotein. \u2022 HUVEC Cells: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) are used to model the vascular endothelium. These cells are instrumental in studying drug transport across blood vessels, angiogenesis, and the effects of drugs on endothelial cell function. \u2022 A549 Cells: Derived from human lung carcinoma, A549 cells are commonly used for respiratory drug delivery studies. These cells provide a relevant model for studying the effects of inhaled drugs and understanding the mechanisms of drug-induced cyto- toxicity in lung tissue. Monolayer cultures are relatively simple to establish and main- tain, making them a convenient choice for many researchers. How- ever, they have limitations, such as the lack of three-dimensional (3D) architecture and the inability to fully replicate the complex interactions and microenvironment of tissues in vivo [12]. 3.1.2 Co-culture Systems Co-culture systems involve growing two or more different cell types together to m", "three-dimensional (3D) architecture and the inability to fully replicate the complex interactions and microenvironment of tissues in vivo [12]. 3.1.2 Co-culture Systems Co-culture systems involve growing two or more different cell types together to mimic complex in vivo interactions, offering a more physiologically relevant model for drug testing, disease mod- eling, and tissue engineering. It employs various con\ufb01gurations such as direct contact, indirect interaction through permeable membranes, and 3D scaffolds to study cell-cell communications. This approach enhances the accuracy of drug screening, improves the understanding of disease mechanisms, and aids in developing complex tissue constructs for regenerative medicine. Examples of co-culture systems include: \u2022 Cancer Metastasis Models: Co-culturing cancer cells with stromal cells, such as \ufb01broblasts or endothelial cells, can provide insights into tumor progression and metastasis. These models help to understand the role of the tumor microenvironment in cancer cell behavior and drug resistance [13].", "In Vitro Models for Drug Delivery Systems 527 \u2022 Immune Response Studies: Co-culture models that include immune cells, such as macrophages or T cells, are used to inves- tigate the immunomodulatory effects of drugs. These systems are valuable for studying the interactions between drugs and the immune system, including the potential for immunotoxicity or immunotherapy ef\ufb01cacy. \u2022 Blood-Brain Barrier Models: Co-culturing endothelial cells with astrocytes or pericytes can create a more physiologically relevant model of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). These models are used to study the permeability of drugs across the BBB and to inves- tigate strategies for enhancing drug delivery to the brain [14, 15]. Co-culture systems provide a more complex and physiologi- cally relevant environment compared to monolayer cultures. How- ever, they are also more challenging to establish and maintain, requiring careful optimization of culture conditions and cell ratios. 3.1.3 3D Cell Cultures Three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures offer a more physiologically relevant environment than 2D monolayers (Table 2). These models better mimic the tissue architecture and cellular heterogeneity found in vivo, making them ideal for studying drug penetration, ef\ufb01cacy, and toxicity. Examples of 3D cell cultures include: 1. Spheroids: Spheroids are typically composed of aggregated cells that self-assemble and form compact structures resembling tissue architecture found in vivo. This characteristic makes them valuable for studying drug delivery mechanisms in a more realistic context. Multicellular spheroids are formed by culturing cells in non-adhesive conditions, leading to the development of cell aggregates that mimic the 3D structure of tumors.

Multicellular spheroids are formed by culturing cells in non-adhesive conditions, leading to the development of cell aggregates that mimic the 3D structure of tumors. Spheroids are valuable for studying drug penetration and ef\ufb01cacy in a more realistic tumor microenvironment. They also allow for the investigation of hypoxic and nutrient-deprived conditions often found in solid tumors [16]. The engineering of spheroids involves various techniques to control their size, composition, and cellular organization. Common methods include hanging drop techniques, microwell arrays, and bioreactors, each offer- ing precise control over spheroid formation and growth. For drug delivery studies, spheroids can be used to evaluate drug penetration, distribution, and ef\ufb01cacy within a 3D micro- environment. Researchers can measure parameters such as drug diffusion kinetics, cellular uptake, and therapeutic response more accurately than with 2D cultures [17]. This makes spher- oids particularly valuable for screening potential drug candi- dates and optimizing drug delivery systems before advancing to in vivo models.", "528 S. Simran Kour et al.

Organoids: Derived from stem cells or primary tissues, orga- noids are miniature, simpli\ufb01ed versions of organs. They retain many characteristics of the actual organ, including cellular diversity, architecture, and functionality. Organoids are used", "In Vitro Models for Drug Delivery Systems 529 to study organ-speci\ufb01c drug effects, disease modeling, and regenerative medicine. Examples include intestinal organoids for studying gut drug absorption and liver organoids for inves- tigating hepatotoxicity. (a) Essential Media for Organoid Growth The development and growth of organoids require media compositions that mimic in vivo stem cell niche signaling pathways, crucial for maintaining stem cell func- tion, promoting their expansion, and guiding their differ- entiation. Most organoids originate from stem cells needing exposure to speci\ufb01c morphogens at de\ufb01ned stages to activate the necessary developmental signaling pathways and enable self-organization. This highlights the critical role and diversity of media compositions in orga- noid cultivation [17]. Different types of organoids require distinct media compositions for proper generation and maintenance. For example, mouse optic cup organoids rely mainly on endogenous signals and are cultured in a serum-free medium with minimal growth factors. These organoids can form a uniform neuroepithelium and self-pattern into various domains such as the neural retina and retinal pigmented epithelium without additional exogenous sig- nals [18]. In contrast, most organoids need media supple- mented with speci\ufb01c exogenous signals to ensure their correct developmental trajectories. Kidney organoids derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), for example, require growth factors like BMP4, activin A, FGF9, BMP7, and RA to stimulate differentiation and self-organization [19]. Other organoids, such as gastric and human fetal-like forebrain organoids, require contin- uous exogenous stimulation during their derivation pro- cess. The media composition for these organoids often includes", "ferentiation and self-organization [19]. Other organoids, such as gastric and human fetal-like forebrain organoids, require contin- uous exogenous stimulation during their derivation pro- cess. The media composition for these organoids often includes growth factors, signaling agonists, and inhibitors, such as Wnt-3A, BMP-4, Activin A, EGF, FGF-10, FGF-7, HGF, and SB 431542, to ensure their intended development and maintenance [20, 21]. (b) Cell Resources for Organoid Generation Organoids can be generated from two main types of stem cells: embryonic pluripotent stem cells (ESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and adult stem cells (ASCs) or organ-speci\ufb01c resident stem cells. ESCs and iPSCs are responsible for embryonic organ develop- ment and can differentiate into various tissue-speci\ufb01c organoids [22]. In contrast, ASCs maintain organ homeo- stasis and regeneration and have been shown to form organoids in vitro with the appropriate extracellular", "matrix (ECM) and molecular signals. For example, mouse intestinal organoids are derived from Lgr5+ ASCs without the need for a mesenchymal niche. Organoids from the surface ectoderm or endodermal lineage, such as glandu- lar tissues, are typically derived from ASCs, dissociated adult tissues, or pluripotent stem cells, whereas neuroec- todermal and mesodermal organoids are usually derived from pluripotent stem cells [23]. 530 S. Simran Kour et al. (c) Matrix for Organoid Generation The matrix that supports cell growth and adherence is crucial for organoid generation. Matrigel, a natural ECM, is widely used for various organoids due to its ability to mimic basement membranes and support cell adhesion and growth. However, Matrigel\u2019s batch-to-batch variabil- ity poses challenges for experimental reproducibility. As a result, synthetic hydrogels such as alginate, hyaluronan- gelatin, and polyethylene glycol are promising alterna- tives. These hydrogels offer de\ufb01ned compositions and control over the cultural environment, although they lack bioactivity and often need customization for speci\ufb01c organoids [24]. Advancements in organoid culture tech- nology have led to the development of co-culture-based organ buds, which do not rely on Matrigel. These organ buds are assembled from various PSC-derived progenitor cells, endothelial cells (ECs), and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) through intercellular and ECM interactions. Sus- pension cultures offer another alternative, promoting organoid growth under matrix-reduced conditions. For instance, kidney micro-organoids have been generated using a suspension culture method, although this approach can sometimes result in functional limitations. 3. Hydrogels: Hydrogels are three-dimensional networks of hydrophilic polymers that provide a s", "ance, kidney micro-organoids have been generated using a suspension culture method, although this approach can sometimes result in functional limitations. 3. Hydrogels: Hydrogels are three-dimensional networks of hydrophilic polymers that provide a scaffold for cell growth. These models are used to study tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and drug delivery. Hydrogels can be designed to mimic the extracellular matrix, providing a supportive environ- ment for cell proliferation and differentiation. Hydrogels have gained signi\ufb01cant attention as an in vitro model for drug delivery due to their unique properties that closely mimic the natural extracellular matrix (ECM) of tissues. These hydrophilic polymer networks can hold large amounts of water, creating a 3D environment that supports cell growth and function, making them ideal for studying drug delivery systems. Hydrogels can be engineered from natural and synthetic polymers, including alginate, gelatin, collagen, and polyethyl- ene glycol (PEG) [25]. The versatility of hydrogels allows for", "precise control over their physical and chemical properties, such as stiffness, porosity, and degradation rate, which are crucial for mimicking speci\ufb01c tissue environments and drug release pro\ufb01les. This tunability enables researchers to design hydrogels that respond to environmental stimuli, such as pH, temperature, or enzymatic activity, for controlled drug release. In Vitro Models for Drug Delivery Systems 531 One of the key advantages of using hydrogels in drug delivery research is their ability to encapsulate a wide range of therapeutic agents, including small molecules, proteins, and nucleic acids, and protect them from degradation. This encap- sulation ensures a sustained and localized release of drugs, enhancing their therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy and reducing systemic side effects [26]. Furthermore, hydrogels can be functionalized with bioactive molecules to promote cell adhesion, prolifera- tion, and differentiation, providing a more physiologically rel- evant model for drug testing. Hydrogels also allow for the creation of complex 3D tissue models that replicate the structural and functional characteris- tics of native tissues. These models are useful for studying drug penetration, distribution, and ef\ufb01cacy in a controlled environ- ment. By incorporating cells into the hydrogel matrix, researchers can observe cellular responses to drugs in real time, gaining valuable insights into drug mechanisms and potential toxicities. 3.2 Tissue Models Tissue models provide a higher level of complexity and physiologi- cal relevance compared to cell culture models. These models are essential for studying drug distribution, ef\ufb01cacy, and toxicity in a context that closely mimics the in vivo environment. 3.2.1 Tissue Explants These involve culturing small pieces of tissue to maintain th", "red to cell culture models. These models are essential for studying drug distribution, ef\ufb01cacy, and toxicity in a context that closely mimics the in vivo environment. 3.2.1 Tissue Explants These involve culturing small pieces of tissue to maintain the origi- nal architecture and cell diversity. These models are bene\ufb01cial for several reasons: \u2022 Preserving Tissue Microenvironment: Tissue explants retain the native extracellular matrix and cell interactions, which are crucial for accurate drug testing. This preservation allows the study of drug effects in a context that closely resembles the in vivo tissue environment. \u2022 Studying Drug Distribution: Tissue explants can be used to evaluate how drugs penetrate and distribute within different tissue types. This information is critical for understanding the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug delivery systems. \u2022 Evaluating Tissue-Speci\ufb01c Responses: Explant models allow researchers to study tissue-speci\ufb01c drug responses, including localized toxicity, in\ufb02ammation, and regenerative effects.", "532 S. Simran Kour et al. Examples of tissue explants include human skin explants for studying topical drug delivery and wound healing, and liver explants for assessing hepatotoxicity and drug metabolism. These tissue slices, derived directly from normal organs and tumor tissues of humans and animals, retain complex structural features and microenvironments when cultured in vitro. However, they are typically viable only for 1\u20132 weeks, making them suitable for short-term studies of disease mechanisms and evaluating the effects of single-use treatments, particularly for immune-related therapies [27]. Techniques for fabricating tissue slices: Tissue Slices can be produced through manual cutting or vibra- tome technology. Manual cutting generates mm-thick, irregularly shaped samples, often resulting in inconsistent cell survival, espe- cially at the sample center. Vibratome technology, which is more commonly used, produces slices ranging from tens to hundreds of microns thick with precise, regular shapes, enhancing their suitabil- ity for culture and testing. Instruments for Tissue Slicing Key equipment for tissue slicing includes the Krumdieck micro- tome, vibratome, and compresstome, which use blade vibrations to minimize pressure and stress on tissue samples. The Krumdieck microtome can cut slices between 100 and 500 \u03bcm at 3\u20134 s per slice. The compresstome, similar in function, cuts slices ranging from 30 to 1000 \u03bcm. The VT1200 S vibratome, commonly used, produces slices of comparable thickness. For this device, tissue is immobilized on a sample table, and slice thickness is controlled by adjusting the table height. Tissue Slice Culture Techniques Following generation, the culture of tissue slices is critical for biological experiments, with factors like slice thickness,", "obilized on a sample table, and slice thickness is controlled by adjusting the table height. Tissue Slice Culture Techniques Following generation, the culture of tissue slices is critical for biological experiments, with factors like slice thickness, culture medium, and methods being crucial. Optimal tissue slice thickness is between 100 and 300 \u03bcm, as this range balances oxygen and nutrient penetration and minimizes cell injury. Media for tissue slices are generally simpler than those for organoid cultures since they do not require differentiation or self-organization. Immune cell cultures necessitate the addition of IL-2, especially for testing immunomodulatory drugs. Typically, tissue slices are cultured on a Millipore \ufb01lter insert to maintain an air-liquid interface. To address intra-slice gradients, micro\ufb02uidic techniques provide a continuous, controlled supply of oxygen, medium, and drugs, enhancing the culture\u2019s effectiveness and consistency [28].", "In Vitro Models for Drug Delivery Systems 533 3.2.2 Engineered Tissue Constructs Engineered tissues are created using biomaterials and cells to repli- cate the structure and function of native tissues. These models are used for various applications, including: \u2022 Skin Models: Engineered skin models consist of layers of kerati- nocytes and \ufb01broblasts arranged to mimic the epidermis and dermis. These models are used for studying topical drug deliv- ery, wound healing, and skin diseases. They provide a valuable platform for testing the ef\ufb01cacy and safety of dermatological products and therapies. \u2022 Liver Models: Engineered liver constructs are used to study hepatotoxicity, drug metabolism, and liver regeneration. These models often incorporate hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells to replicate the cellular diversity and functionality of the liver. They are essential for evaluating the hepatic metabolism of drugs and the potential for liver toxicity. \u2022 Cardiac Models: Engineered cardiac tissues are used to study the effects of drugs on heart function, including contractility and electrophysiology. These models are valuable for assessing the cardiotoxicity of new drugs and for developing treatments for heart diseases. \u2022 Bone and Cartilage Models: Engineered bone and cartilage tis- sues are used for studying orthopedic drug delivery, tissue engi- neering, and regenerative medicine. These models provide insights into the effects of drugs on bone and cartilage repair and regeneration. Engineered tissue constructs offer signi\ufb01cant advantages by providing a more realistic representation of the target tissue. How- ever, they also present challenges in terms of reproducibility, scal- ability, and the need for advanced tissue engineering techniques. 3.3 Organ-on-a-Chip Models Organ-on", "ntages by providing a more realistic representation of the target tissue. How- ever, they also present challenges in terms of reproducibility, scal- ability, and the need for advanced tissue engineering techniques. 3.3 Organ-on-a-Chip Models Organ-on-a-chip (OoC) technology involves micro\ufb02uidic devices that simulate entire organs\u2019 activities, mechanics, and physiological responses. These models provide a high level of control over the cellular microenvironment and can replicate dynamic physiological conditions such as \ufb02uid \ufb02ow and mechanical forces. Essential Factors in Organ-Chip Technology: One of the pri- mary objectives of micro\ufb02uidic organ chips is to replicate the in vivo circulatory system and extracellular \ufb02uid environment for cultured cells and tissues. Achieving this requires precise control over culture chambers and liquid \ufb02ow systems. The design and regulation of the chamber\u2019s volume, \ufb02ow paths, and medium input and output are crucial, as they affect the medium \ufb02ow rate, thereby in\ufb02uencing cell and tissue culture [29]. Organ chip designs vary signi\ufb01cantly depending on their appli- cations, but they generally follow similar principles: incorporating culture chambers and \ufb02uid chambers. These components are", "essential structures, with the main variation being in their con\ufb01gu- ration. The two most prevalent designs are strip-type and round- hole-type culture chambers. For example, Emulate Inc.\u2019s classical chip features two strip-type chambers (top and bottom channels) separated by a porous polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane. Cells are seeded on both sides of this membrane, creating a dynamic environment for cell culture. Conversely, TissUse GmbH\u2019s classical chip utilizes a round hole connected by various micro\ufb02uidic chan- nels, where cells, organoids, and other samples are cultured [30]. 534 S. Simran Kour et al. Despite the similarities in culture chamber structures, organ chips can achieve diverse functions based on \ufb02uid \ufb02ow direction and mechanisms. One common method generates \ufb02ow using pressure from a pump, creating a unidirectional \ufb02ow from the input to the output side of the culture chamber. Another technique involves oscillating the liquid by placing a chip plate containing medium on a shaking device that mimics a seesaw motion. This motion causes the \ufb02uid to \ufb02ow from a higher to a lower position, generating unidirectional \ufb02ow, and then reversing as the device changes position. Different cells and tissues experience varying \ufb02uid \ufb02ow stresses in vivo, necessitating speci\ufb01c optimal shear stresses and tolerance ranges. Thus, the \ufb02ow rate is a critical parameter, as it affects the \ufb02uid \ufb02ow stress experienced by the cultured samples [31]. Selection of Materials for Micro\ufb02uidic Organ Chips: The selec- tion of materials for micro\ufb02uidic chips is critical in enabling their application in drug development, primarily in\ufb02uencing the com- patibility and interaction of drugs within these models.

Biocompat- ibility stands as the foremost consideration, crucial for supporting biological cultures within micro\ufb02uidic organ chips. Secondary con- siderations include the interaction with drugs or detection reagents, where materials with high binding af\ufb01nity or drug adsorp- tion properties can potentially interfere with drug screening out- comes or fundamental medical research [30, 31]. Other factors such as optical transparency, fabrication complexity, mechanical properties, and cost are also pivotal in material selection [32]. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is widely favored in micro\ufb02uidic devices due to its transparency, ease of fabrication, and biocompat- ibility. Its low af\ufb01nity for hydrophobic drugs makes it suitable for drug screening and delivery studies. However, PDMS can adsorb hydrophobic drugs, leading to gradual depletion from the solution. Glass is another commonly used material offering excellent chemical resistance and optical transparency. Its minimal drug adsorption properties make it suitable for drug investigations requiring precise control over drug concentrations. Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), a cost-effective transparent material, possesses favorable optical properties and low drug adsorption characteristics, making it popular in micro\ufb02uidic devices and drug compatibility studies.", "In Vitro Models for Drug Delivery Systems 535 Additionally, natural biomaterials such as gelatin, alginate, and collagen, along with synthetic polymers like poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), are also employed in the fabrication of micro\ufb02uidic chips [33]. Each material choice in micro\ufb02uidic organ chips is carefully evaluated based on its ability to maintain biocompatibility, mini- mize drug interference, and meet speci\ufb01c operational require- ments, such as optical clarity and mechanical stability. These considerations ensure that micro\ufb02uidic models remain reliable tools in drug development and biomedical research. Different organ-on-a-chip models have become essential tools in neuroscience, notably for studying the BBB, brain-gut-micro- biota axis, and neurodegenerative disorders (Table 3). 3.3.1 Lung-on-a-Chip Lung-on-a-chip models incorporate epithelial and endothelial cells with a \ufb02exible membrane to mimic the lung\u2019s air-blood barrier and breathing motions.

These systems integrate multiple engineered human tissues, such as the heart, liver, bone, and skin, linked by a recirculating vascular \ufb02ow. This setup allows the tissues to physiologically communicate, mim- icking the interdependent functions of human organs. Each tissue is maintained in its optimized environment, separated from the com- mon vascular \ufb02ow by a selectively permeable endothelial barrier. This design preserves the tissues\u2019 molecular, structural, and func- tional phenotypes over extended periods, typically around four weeks. The system\u2019s ability to recapitulate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic pro\ufb01les makes it particularly valuable for drug testing. For example, the multi-organ chip can simulate the human body\u2019s response to doxorubicin, a chemotherapy drug, allowing researchers to identify early biomarkers of cardiotoxicity, such as speci\ufb01c miRNAs. By maintaining tissue phenotypes and enabling inter-organ communication, these chips enhance the predictive accuracy of drug responses compared to isolated tissue cultures or interconnected tissues without endothelial barriers. This advance- ment could signi\ufb01cantly improve the clinical relevance of tissue chips, providing a more reliable platform for evaluating drug ef\ufb01- cacy and safety, and ultimately facilitating the development of safer and more effective therapeutics [30, 33]. \u2022 These models are crucial for: Pharmacokinetics: Understanding the ADME (absorption, dis- tribution, metabolism, and excretion) pro\ufb01le of drugs.

Smart drug delivery systems, often referred to as nanocarrier-based delivery systems, are a product of nanotechnology. Alongside other digital medical technologies like arti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), the \ufb01eld of nanotechnology has experienced remarkable breakthroughs in both develop- ment and reach. Apart from medications based on nanoparticles, innovative biologicals, gene therapy, microsponge drug delivery systems, intrathecal drug delivery systems, transdermal drug delivery, inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs), hydrogels, liposomes, and personalized medicine have surfaced as potentially viable methods of drug delivery with minimal adverse effects. Working together and doing continuous research are crucial to creating innovative medication delivery systems that have a big in\ufb02uence on how well diseases are treated.

Working together and doing continuous research are crucial to creating innovative medication delivery systems that have a big in\ufb02uence on how well diseases are treated. Before being used in a clinical setting, the drug delivery systems must pass stringent safety and effectiveness testing and ful\ufb01l regulatory requirements.

The yearly cost of drug mistakes has been estimated to reach $42 billion USD worldwide [1]. Drug scarcities are becoming a bigger issue in wealthy nations. Not only have shortages impacted more pharmaceuticals than ever before, but they have also lasted longer, implicated more manufacturers, and impacted more therapeutic classes [2]. There are several organiza- tional and technological factors that have been linked to medication Abhishek Pathak and Satya Pal Singh (eds.), Next-Generation Drug Delivery Systems, Methods in Pharmacology and Toxicology, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-4554-3_24, \u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025 547", "shortages, including issues with how pharmaceuticals are produced, governed, purchased, and administered by medical professionals [3]. Drug shortages endanger not just the health of individual patients but also that of the general populace. Drug shortages do, in fact, pose a \u201cpublic health crisis\u201d since they jeopardize our capacity to treat and prevent both acute and chronic illnesses [4]. This is likely most evident in the context of infectious illnesses, where a number of antimicrobial medicines are now in short supply, which raises the possibility of resistance and the spread of infec- tions. These medication shortages might have a signi\ufb01cant impact on public health [5]. Scarcity of tuberculin puri\ufb01ed protein deriva- tive (PPD), a pure protein that is used to identify TB infection [6] as well as shortages of a number of common pediatric vaccinations, such as those for pneumococcal disease, acellular pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus toxoids, and Haemophilus in\ufb02uenza type b (Hib) [7]. Drug shortages also impede clinical research, resulting in trial sizes being reduced, altered, or discon- tinued entirely. This poses a danger to the advancement of knowl- edge and the practice of evidence-based medicine [8] and makes it challenging for medical professionals to adhere to evidence-based clinical practice recommendations [9, 10]. When doctors and patients are required to utilize medications they are unfamiliar with, medication mistakes are more likely to happen [5, 11]. 548 Rajesh Sudhakar Wakchaure et al. 2 Routes for Administering Drugs Drug administration routes can be roughly classi\ufb01ed into two groups: systemic and local.

Parenteral routes include injection, sublingual, and inhalation, whereas systemic routes include enteral, which also includes oral and rectal (drug is delivered directly into the gastrointestinal tract [GIT]). In addition, injections might be subcutaneous (SC, beneath the skin), intramuscular (IM, into the muscle), or intravenous (IV, into the vein). Local route is one of the easiest ways to administer medication as it allows you to deliver it where you want it to work. 2.1 Topical Medication used locally on the skin or mucous membrane. 2.2 Oral Cavity Medication, such as clotrimazole troche for oral diseases, can only be administered to the oral mucosa in the form of rinses. 2.3 Gastrointestinal Tract (GIT) Nonabsorbable medications, such as neomycin for gut sterilization prior to surgery, may only be used locally. 2.3.1 Rectum and Anal Canal This area is utilized to provide liquid or solid medications for a variety of purposes.", "Ethical and Safety Considerations in Drug Delivery Systems 549 2.3.2 Evacuant Enema This method uses medications, such soap water enema, to evacuate the intestine. Water stimulates the rectum, while soap serves as a lubricant. 2.3.3 Retention Enema Methyl prednisolone is used in ulcerative colitis. Bisacodyl is placed into the rectum to facilitate bowel evacuation. 2.4 Eye, Ear, and Nose Drugs can be delivered to nasal mucosa, eyes, or ear canal in the form of drops, ointments, and sprays. This route can be employed for allergic/infective conditions of these organs. 2.5 Bronchi This route of drug administration is used for conditions like bron- chial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), wherein drug is absorbed by bronchial mucosa through inhalation, for example, salbutamol. 2.6 Vagina Drugs can be applied/inserted in the form of tablet, cream, or pessary to vagina. This route is mainly used for vaginal candidiasis. 2.7 Urethra Medication in the form of solution/jellies can be applied to ure- thra, for example, lignocaine. 3 Systemic Route The substance enters the bloodstream by the systemic pathway, travels throughout the body, and has systemic effects. This delivery method can be broadly classi\ufb01ed as enteral, parenteral, or specialty medication delivery. Oral and rectal routes are included in the enteral route. 3.1 Oral Route This is the most often used and approved method of administering medication. When taken orally, the medication enters the blood- stream and is extensively absorbed by all bodily tissues. The oral route has the bene\ufb01ts of being painless, safe, and practical for long- term and repeated usage. Additionally, the medication can be self- administered via this method without the need for expert interven- tion. The oral route, howeve", "issues. The oral route has the bene\ufb01ts of being painless, safe, and practical for long- term and repeated usage. Additionally, the medication can be self- administered via this method without the need for expert interven- tion. The oral route, however, has a few drawbacks, including a sluggish beginning of effect that makes it unsuitable for emergency situations, unpleasant or irritating pharmaceuticals (like chloram- phenicol), drugs that cannot be absorbed (like neomycin), and medications that are broken down by the digestive system (like insulin). They cannot be administered to individuals who are asleep, unwilling, untrustworthy, or who are experiencing diarrhea or vomiting, among other disadvantages. Oral dosage forms come in a variety of forms, including liquid preparations like syrups and suspensions and solid forms like tablets and capsules. The process of making tablets involves compressing powdered medication with", "binding agents and excipients, while the gelatin shell found in capsules is a naturally occurring, tasteless material. There are two kinds of capsules available: soft gelatin capsules that contain the medicine in an oily liquid form and hard gelatin capsules that carry the drug in a solid form. Oral liquid solutions might be utilized when a young child has dif\ufb01culty swallowing pills or capsules. Acetate and cellulose are used to coat tablets in an enteric layer. Bene\ufb01ts include preventing gastrointestinal discomfort, shielding the medication from stomach acid, and delaying drug absorption to lengthen the duration of effect. Conversely, various coatings in sustained/controlled release formulations disintegrate at varying rates. This formulation, which includes sustained-release nifedi- pine, has the advantage of having an extended duration of action, which reduces the need for frequent doses and increases patient compliance. 550 Rajesh Sudhakar Wakchaure et al. 3.2 Sublingual Route A lipid-soluble medication is crushed and administered to the buccal mucosa, or it is stored beneath the tongue. Drugs such as buprenorphine and nitroglycerine are absorbed into the veins that surround the oral mucosa. Later, they enter the superior vena cava and the heart, and \ufb01nally, they reach the systemic circulation. This approach has the advantage of making medications with high \ufb01rst- pass hepatic metabolism easily obtainable in the bloodstream when administered this way. Additional bene\ufb01ts include the drug\u2019s self- administration capabilities, quick start of action, and tablet spitting as a way to stop the medication\u2019s effects. Due to its irritating, lipid- insoluble, and unpleasant properties, this method cannot be admi- nistered. It also cannot be applied to minors. 4 Rectal Route In a", ", quick start of action, and tablet spitting as a way to stop the medication\u2019s effects. Due to its irritating, lipid- insoluble, and unpleasant properties, this method cannot be admi- nistered. It also cannot be applied to minors. 4 Rectal Route In addition to local effects, this route can be employed for systemic effects. Hemorrhoidal veins absorb medications, partially avoiding liver metabolism. This approach has the bene\ufb01t of allowing the administration of irritating or unpleasant drugs. It can be for individuals who are recurrent or recalcitrant vomiters. However, it has drawbacks such as causing embarrassment to patients, irregular drug absorption, and causing rectal irritation when administering irritant medications, such as diazepam for pediatric febrile convulsions. 5 Parenteral Route The parenteral route is an alternative method of administering medication to the enteral route. It covers medications used topi- cally, intravenously, and via inhalation. Its advantages include its", "quick onset, making it useful in emergency situations. It can also be used for patients who have diarrhea or vomiting. This method works well for irritants, medications damaged by the digestive juices, oral non-absorptive medications, and pharmaceuticals with high \ufb01rst-pass metabolism. This route\u2019s drawbacks include cost and dif\ufb01culty in self-administering. This method is used to give volatile liquids and gases, such as general anesthetics. Drugs inhaled have a quick effect because of the alveoli\u2019s large surface area for absorp- tion. Furthermore, any residual medication in the alveoli will be rapidly evacuated upon cessation of treatment. Thus, this approach may be used to achieve both moment-to-moment drug control and cessation of pharmacological activity. However, bronchospasm and increased respiratory secretion can be brought on by irritating medications. Ethical and Safety Considerations in Drug Delivery Systems 551 5.1 Transdermal Route Patches introduce medication into the bloodstream to provide systemic effects. Patches have many layers, such as an adhesive layer with a priming dosage, a drug reservoir, a backing \ufb01lm, and a rate-controlling micropore membrane. Examples of these layers include nitroglycerine for angina, estrogen for hormone replace- ment therapy (HRT), and fentanyl for motion sickness. Self- administration, strong patient compliance, sustained action, few side effects, and consistent medication plasma concentrations are a few bene\ufb01ts of this approach. Nevertheless, there are disadvan- tages to this approach, including cost, local discomfort (itching, dermatitis), and the possibility of the patch falling out of sight during injection. 5.2 Intradermal Route A medication is injected into the skin\u2019s dermal layer. Examples of this include drug sensiti", "proach, including cost, local discomfort (itching, dermatitis), and the possibility of the patch falling out of sight during injection. 5.2 Intradermal Route A medication is injected into the skin\u2019s dermal layer. Examples of this include drug sensitivity testing and the Bacillus Calmette- Guerin (BCG) immunization. 5.3 Subcutaneous Route (SC) Injectable drugs, such as insulin and adrenaline, are administered into SC tissue, which has a lower vascular supply but a nerve supply. This method cannot be utilized in an emergency since it has a sluggish start and is inappropriate for irritating medications. 5.4 Intramuscular Route (IM) In youngsters, the deltoid, gluteus maximus, and lateral side of the thigh are the main muscles into which the drug is injected. As opposed to the oral route, this one allows for a quicker start of action. Depot preparations, mild irritants, soluble materials, and suspensions can all be administered using this method. However, the IM route is unpleasant, can result in an abscess and local tissue damage, and must be administered by professionals in an aseptic state.", "552 Rajesh Sudhakar Wakchaure et al. 5.5 Intravenous (IV) Route A direct medication infusion into a vein. The medication can be administered slowly by IV infusion or as a bolus. Bolus administra- tion refers to the quick or slow injection of a single, big dosage of medication, such as furosemide, whereas gradual IV injection entails adding the drug to a bottle containing saline or dextrose, such as dopamine infusion in cardiogenic shock. This method is appropriate for emergencies since it can achieve 100% bioavailabil- ity and a quick beginning of action. For instance, drowsiness hap- pens in two to four minutes when the sedative medication midazolam is injected intravenously. Furthermore, this method may be used to provide huge amounts of irritating medications, including anticancer medicines, and \ufb02uids, like dextrose. This kind of administration can be used to maintain a constant plasma con- centration. But once a medicine is administered, its effects cannot be stopped. When a medication is administered this way, it may result in necrosis, thrombophlebitis, and local discomfort. Its addi- tional disadvantages include the need for extremely aseptic settings and the inability of self-administration. Furthermore, depot pre- parations are not permitted. When administering medications by IV, care should be taken to make sure the needle tip is in the vein and to provide the medication slowly. 5.6 Intra-Arterial Method This method is employed when a medication is intended to have a localized impact in a certain tissue or organ. For instance, a medi- cation is injected into the carotid artery or renal artery, respectively, to treat head/neck cancer and kidney tumors. 5.7 Intrathecal Route Subarachnoid space injection of medication (into cerebrospinal \ufb02uid, or CSF). This appro", "or instance, a medi- cation is injected into the carotid artery or renal artery, respectively, to treat head/neck cancer and kidney tumors. 5.7 Intrathecal Route Subarachnoid space injection of medication (into cerebrospinal \ufb02uid, or CSF). This approach can be used to directly provide medication to the central nervous system (CNS), such as lignocaine for spinal anesthesia or antibiotics for meningitis. 5.8 Epidural Route Injecting medication into the space, which is outside the dura mater known as epidural space. Since the medication is not injected directly into the CSF, it differs from intrathecal. This method of administering local anesthetics provides analgesia during delivery. 5.9 Intra-Articular Route An injection of a medication, such as hydrocortisone for rheuma- toid arthritis, is given into the joint space. Repeated use of this method may result in cartilage injury and needs aseptic conditions [12]. 6 Injectable Medication Delivery Iatrogenic damage is extremely expensive in terms of prolonged hospital stays, resources used, patient injuries, patient deaths, and destroyed careers [13, 14]. According to the Institute of Medicine", "Report, avoidable adverse events related to medical treatment are thought to be the cause of between 44,000 and 98,000 fatalities annually in the United States. [15]. One of the main causes of such injury has been shown to be drug administration errors [16]. This is especially concerning in the \ufb01eld of anesthesia due to the enor- mous number of medications that anesthetists must employ [17]. Furthermore, mistakes made when administering drugs have been found to be the most frequent reason for consciousness while under anesthesia and to be a recurring reason for events in the recovery area [18, 19]. To lower mistake and promote safe practice, created a novel injectable medication delivery method [20]. The insights learned via empirical event reporting were used to create the system [21]. The mental processes that give rise to human mistakes [22] and safe system design safe system design guidelines established in the nuclear, chemical, and aviation sectors\u2014high-risk industries [23]. Specialized trays, pre\ufb01lled syringes labeled with color and bar codes for the most popular anesthetic medications, and automatic visual and audio veri\ufb01cation of syringes using a computer and bar codes right before each drug administration are all features of the new system. Additionally, a timed log of all the medications given throughout the anesthesia is compiled by the new system. For anesthetic medications to have the desired effects, the right dosage and mode of administration must be used. This is critical for patient safety since anesthetic medications work by slowing down the circulatory and central nervous systems, which can have potentially fatal consequences if dosed or given incorrectly. Patients who are zoologic companion animals can be safely and reliably put to sleep using a var", "medications work by slowing down the circulatory and central nervous systems, which can have potentially fatal consequences if dosed or given incorrectly. Patients who are zoologic companion animals can be safely and reliably put to sleep using a variety of medication delivery techni- ques and routes of administration. Anesthetic techniques have dangers that the anesthetist should be aware of in order to carefully prepare operations that are as safe and effective as feasible given the nature of zoologic companion animal treatment [24]. Ethical and Safety Considerations in Drug Delivery Systems 553 7 Microsponge Drug Delivery Systems (MDS) Microsponges are intended to effectively administer an active phar- maceutical component at the lowest possible dosage, as well as to improve stability, lessen adverse effects, and alter drug release [25]. By trapping medications that aren\u2019t very soluble in water in the microsponge system\u2019s pores, it has been demonstrated that the system can accelerate the rate of solubilization of certain medica- tions when used orally. The medicine is effectively reduced to minute particles due to these extremely tiny holes, which enhances their surface area and signi\ufb01cantly speeds up the solubilization process. A further advantage is that the microsponge system takes a lot longer to pass through the small and large intestines, which maximizes the quantity of medication absorbed. Because", "microsponge technology is safe, is easy to manufacture, and has the bene\ufb01t of programmable release, it provides a special platform for topical administration. MDS has become highly competitive and rapidly evolving technology, and more and more research should be carried out for cost-effective therapy. MDS holds a promising future in various pharmaceutical applications in the coming years, as it has unique properties like enhanced product performance and elegancy, extended release, reduced irritation, improved thermal, physical, and chemical stability, and thus \ufb02exibility to develop novel product forms. MDS was originally developed for topical delivery of drugs, but nowadays it can also be used for controlled oral delivery of drugs using bioerodible polymers, especially for colon- speci\ufb01c delivery. Future research will focus heavily on microsponge delivery systems, which have a signi\ufb01cant in\ufb02uence on the health- care system and can accurately control release rates or target phar- maceuticals to a speci\ufb01c body location [26]. 554 Rajesh Sudhakar Wakchaure et al. 8 Intrathecal Drug Delivery Systems (IDDSs) Intrathecal drug delivery systems (IDDSs) transport ziconotide or morphine sulfate, which are FDA-approved medications, straight to the spinal cord without the need for preservatives. Comparing IDDS to placebo and conventional medical treatment (CMM), it has been shown to provide better cancer pain control [27]. IDDS helps such patients reduce or stop using their systemic medications, which lowers their risk [28] and results in considerable cost savings [29]. 9 Transdermal Drug Delivery Transdermal distribution is a promising substitute for oral medica- tion administration and may also offer an option to hypodermic injection [30, 31]. Additionally, transdermal distributio", "n considerable cost savings [29]. 9 Transdermal Drug Delivery Transdermal distribution is a promising substitute for oral medica- tion administration and may also offer an option to hypodermic injection [30, 31]. Additionally, transdermal distribution is prefer- able to hypodermic injections, which are uncomfortable, produce hazardous medical waste, and increase the risk of disease transmis- sion through reused needles, particularly in impoverished nations [32]. Transdermal systems can also be self-administered and are non-invasive. They can offer relief for extended durations, up to a week. In addition, they enhance patient adherence, and the systems are often affordable. Transdermal delivery system (TDS) innova- tions have advanced therapy delivery with both new and old med- ications, which have had a signi\ufb01cant positive impact on medical practice. Compared to alternative delivery methods, TDS offers several bene\ufb01ts, including longer-lasting and more consistent med- ication levels [33], the option to stop therapy suddenly by taking off the patch and dosing less often. By delivering drugs through the", "skin, patients can avoid gastrointestinal side effects and hepatic \ufb01rst- pass metabolism, as well as the uncomfortable and painful rectal or injectable procedures. Ethical and Safety Considerations in Drug Delivery Systems 555 10 Mass Drug Administration (MDA) A potential global health strategy seems to be mass drug adminis- tration (MDA), which is the empirical delivery of medication to a community or group that is considered to be at-risk. [34, 35]. Tra- choma, a bacterial cause of blindness that affects around two mil- lion people yearly, has been treated with MDA [36], and MDA initiatives are often employed to combat additional underdiag- nosed tropical illnesses [37, 38]. In an attempt to lower the preva- lence of soil-transmitted helminth infection, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, and lymphatic \ufb01lariasis, MDA programs have been implemented. [39\u201342]. The public must be convinced to participate in MDAs for the bene\ufb01t of both present and future populations as well as for their personal well-being in order for properly focused MDAs to be effective. 11 Smart Drug Delivery Systems (SDDSs) The development of smart nanocarrier-based drug delivery sys- tems, often referred to as smart drug delivery systems (SDDSs), was prompted by the nonspeci\ufb01c dispersion and unpredictable release of pharmaceuticals in conventional drug delivery systems (CDDSs). To lessen the negative effects of CDDSs, SDDSs can administer medications to the target locations in a spatially regu- lated way and at a lower dose frequency. Targeting strategies, stimulation tactics, and smart nanocarriers make up a smart medi- cation delivery system. Recently, solid-state dielectric solid has been developed for various smart nanocarriers, such as carbon nano- tubes, quantum dots, liposomes, micelles, dendrime", "timulation tactics, and smart nanocarriers make up a smart medi- cation delivery system. Recently, solid-state dielectric solid has been developed for various smart nanocarriers, such as carbon nano- tubes, quantum dots, liposomes, micelles, dendrimers, meso- porous silica nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, super-paramagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles, and carbon nanotubes [43]. 11.1 Smart Nanocarriers Nanoparticles are generally de\ufb01ned as particles with at least one dimension between one and one hundred nm. Currently, volume speci\ufb01c surface area (VSSA) is used to de\ufb01ne nanoparticles. Nano- particles are generally characterized as particles with a VSSA of 60 m2 /cm3 or above in the volume of the substance [44]. Nano- carriers are nanoparticles that act as modules of transport for other substances. When stimulated internally or externally, conventional nanocarriers are unable to deliver and release medications at the proper concentration at the intended location. As a result, conven- tional nanocarriers are not intelligent. To make things intelligent,", "they must be changed or made more functional. The following qualities should be present in smart nanocarriers: (1) Intelligent nanocarriers ought to steer clear of the immune system\u2019s puri\ufb01ca- tion procedure. (2) They must only be gathered at the intended location. (3) When stimulated internally or externally, the smart nanocarrier should release the payload at the proper concentration at the intended location. (4) In addition to chemotherapy, they ought to co-deliver genetic materials, imaging agents, and other materials [45]. 556 Rajesh Sudhakar Wakchaure et al. 11.2 Nanoparticles in Drug Delivery Drugs entrapped in nanoparticles are intended to improve drug delivery to or uptake by target cells and/or lessen the toxicity of the free drug to organs that are not target organs. In both cases, there will be a rise in the therapeutic index, toxicity to other organ systems, and therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy (such as tumor cell death) due to the margin between doses. Long-lived and target-speci\ufb01c nanopar- ticles must be made in order to achieve these goals. The majority of the substances are biodegradable polymers that, upon breakdown, release the medication. The trapping of particle medication carriers, including nanomaterials, in the liver and spleen\u2019s mononuclear phagocytic system is one of the issues with their utilization [46, 47]. However, when treating liver illnesses like hepatitis or tumor metastasis, liver-targeting nanoparticles may be advanta- geous. The content may be selectively released using thermosensi- tive nanoparticles following particular localization. A signi\ufb01cant obstacle in medication distribution is getting the medication where it is required in the body without having any negative effects on organs that are not sick. This is particularly dif\ufb01cult when treati", " following particular localization. A signi\ufb01cant obstacle in medication distribution is getting the medication where it is required in the body without having any negative effects on organs that are not sick. This is particularly dif\ufb01cult when treating cancer as the tumor may spread to other organs as separate metastases. Thus, the whole therapeutic potential of chemotherapy is limited by its non-restricted cytotoxicity. Increased local drug concentrations are the outcome of local drug delivery or drug targeting, which also offers methods for more focused therapy. Certain particles in nanoparticles act as instruments to make these tactics possible. Bene\ufb01ts include lysosomal escape following endo- cytosis, protein binding and stability, and cell membrane penetra- tion due to their tiny size. Pharmaceutical sciences have been using nanoparticles for decades to lessen the toxicity and adverse effects of medications. It was not known until recently that the patient may be at risk from these carrier systems. When employing nanoparticles for medication delivery, risks are added that go beyond those caused by standard risks imposed by substances in delivery matrix. Nevertheless, there is currently a lack of a scienti\ufb01c paradigm regarding the potential adverse reactivity of nanoparticles, and our knowledge of the fundamentals of how these particles interact with live cells, organs, and organisms is limited. In order to create and use safe nanoparticles in medication delivery in the future, a conceptual knowledge of biological reactions to nanomaterials is", "ons to nanomaterials is", "required. Developing tailored drug delivery systems for a variety of disorders, including cancer cells, is a potential area of study in nanomedicine. Due to cancer cells\u2019 high rates of proliferation and resistance to conventional treatment approaches, researchers are concentrating on lipid-based drug delivery, which employs nano- particles to encapsulate and transport medications to certain cells or tissues [ ]. Extensive research and optimization efforts are being carried out to \ufb01ne-tune the size, surface charge, and composition of these nanoparticles in order to guarantee their ef\ufb01cacy and safety. Additionally, in order to guarantee their safety in clinical applica- tions, researchers are looking at their possible toxicity and biocom- patibility [ ]. The therapy of cancer involves the use of many kinds of nanoparticles. Chemotherapy medications can be directly deliv- ered to cancer cells using nanoparticles, increasing their ef\ufb01cacy and lowering their negative effects [ ]. By causing hyperthermia, they can also heat up and kill cancer cells. Furthermore, by improving medical imaging methods, nanoparticles can improve tumor sur- veillance and localization. All things considered, nanoparticles have enormous promise for enhancing oncology and patient outcomes [ ]. Thus, before moving on with human studies, it is imperative to fully explore these parameters and comprehend their impact on the behavior of nanoparticles. Furthermore, the effective transla- tion of nanoparticles into therapeutic applications will depend on the development of techniques to maximize their stability and minimize organ accumulation [ ]. Personalized medicine, gene therapy, inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs), new biologicals, nanoparticle-based drug delivery methods, and gene therapy have all shown pr", "elopment of techniques to maximize their stability and minimize organ accumulation [ ]. Personalized medicine, gene therapy, inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs), new biologicals, nanoparticle-based drug delivery methods, and gene therapy have all shown promise in improving medication delivery while mini- mizing adverse effects. Presently, there is a lot of focus on creating novel drug delivery methods based on nanoparticles that can target certain cells, such as lung epithelial cells and macrophages, while reducing systemic adverse effects. These systems use nanoparticles, which are minuscule particles with sizes between one and one hundred nanometers, to encapsulate and provide medications directly to the lung tissue that is af\ufb02icted [ ]. Through surface modi\ufb01cation, scientists can improve the capacity of nanoparticles to bind to particular lung cell types, increasing the effectiveness of medication delivery and decreasing side effects [ ]. Moreover, drug delivery systems based on nanoparticles can strengthen and shield the pharmaceuticals against deterioration, guaranteeing a longer therapeutic impact and continuous release [ ]. For a long time, inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) have been a mainstay therapy for chronic in\ufb02ammatory respiratory illnesses, in addition to sys- tems based on nanoparticles [ , ]. In order to relieve symptoms and stop them from getting worse, ICSs function by decreasing airway in\ufb02ammation. The use of nanotechnology in healthcare continues to offer ef\ufb01cient methods for managing a range of chronic conditions and enhancing patient outcomes. It has been 57 56 55 54 53 52 51 50 49 48 Ethical and Safety Considerations in Drug Delivery Systems 557", "ns and enhancing patient outcomes.

In these sys- tems, medications are delivered directly to target cells in the lungs by the use of nanoscale-sized manufactured particles [59]. Com- pared to traditional drug delivery techniques, nanoparticles provide a number of bene\ufb01ts, such as increased targeting, less toxicity, and better bioavailability [60]. 558 Rajesh Sudhakar Wakchaure et al. 11.3 Nanomedical Technology The design, manufacture, and use of systems, structures, and devices at the nanoscopic size is known as nanotechnology [61]. Alongside other digital medical technologies like arti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), the \ufb01eld of nanotech- nology has experienced remarkable breakthroughs in both devel- opment and reach. These advancements offer signi\ufb01cant potential for the delivery of nanoscopic personalized medicine and healthcare strategies, particularly in the areas of machine learning (ML) and big data accumulation by arti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI) that facilitate faster, more ef\ufb01cient cross-platform communication and better, more accurate interpretations [62]. Particularly in terms of health and medical applications, nanomedical devices are becoming more and more connected with the so-called \u201cInternet of Things,\u201d which includes smartphones and wearables. Furthermore, advancements in health monitoring nanomedical technology make it simple for physicians to keep an eye on blood vessel glucose levels [63].

The growing ability of ", "toring nanomedical technology make it simple for physicians to keep an eye on blood vessel glucose levels [63]. Cardiac stent nanosensors used to identify stented heart arteries that are obstructed by in-stent restenosis [64]. The growing ability of medical equipment to collect patient data is a problem as nano- medical devices become more technologically sophisticated and increasingly integrated with other forms of technology, such as AI and ML. The identi\ufb01cation and recording of physical changes in patients as well as the gathering of information to spot patterns and trends in users\u2019 daily lives over long stretches of time draw attention to problems related to informational asymmetry. The sensitivity of nanotechnology in medical devices implies that a vast amount of health data may be produced using nanotechnology in medicine. Patients may be put in danger if their data is used against them in situations where it is logged to compare data groupings or train AI systems. This is because health data may be combined into massive digital storage systems. There are several possible hazards and advantages for consumers when using this data [65, 66]. The importance of each person\u2019s right to privacy as a possible safeguard against improper use of data and other researchers contend that in order to safeguard users and patients participating in studies that advance the development of nanomedical technology, legal mea- sures that uphold and codify the right to privacy are essential [67]. Researchers now see that there is a problem with uneven", "h uneven", "access to nanotechnology that has to be \ufb01xed [68], speci\ufb01cally argues that worldwide action should be made to encourage equality of access and that mankind should participate in the bene\ufb01ts of scienti\ufb01c research. Research on nanobiotechnologies for drug delivery aims to achieve many key objectives, such as more precise drug targeting and distribution, lower toxicity while preserving therapeutic bene\ufb01ts, enhanced safety and biocompatibility, and accelerated discovery of novel, safe medications. The following subjects, which are fundamental requirements for the creation of novel materials, are crucial to the quest for suitable carriers as drug delivery systems. They include information about (i) drug release and incorporation, (ii) stability and shelf life of formulations, (iii) biocompatibility, (iv) biodistribution and targeting, and (v) functionality. Furthermore, it is important to take into account any potential negative consequences of leftover material following medication delivery when using it only as a carrier. Ethical and Safety Considerations in Drug Delivery Systems 559 11.4 Liposomes in Drug Delivery Drugs that are hydrophilic or hydrophobic can be made more soluble and permeable by using liposomes as a drug delivery method. But in a biological setting, pH, enzymes, and the immune system quickly break down ordinary liposomes. Because of this, using it to provide speci\ufb01c routes will release the medication right away, making it impossible to keep the active ingredient stable. A potential resolution to this issue involves utilizing a polymer to alter the liposome\u2019s structure. A liposome complex is the result of the liposome and polymer complexing. It is well recognized that com- plexing liposomes with polymers can enhance their physicochemi- cal characteristics", "volves utilizing a polymer to alter the liposome\u2019s structure. A liposome complex is the result of the liposome and polymer complexing. It is well recognized that com- plexing liposomes with polymers can enhance their physicochemi- cal characteristics, making them suitable for speci\ufb01c drug delivery and controlled release. Because the liposome complex system is more effective at shielding active ingredients from chemicals, enzymes, the immune system, and even photolysis processes, it becomes more durable and stable [69]. Because of the properties of lipids, liposomes have two signi\ufb01cant bene\ufb01ts in the medication administration of living organisms: biocompatibility and biode- gradability [70]. Liposomes can be made of a variety of lipids and amphiphiles. Moreover, polymers may be utilized to create poly- merosomes, which are novel medication and gene carriers. One important option for enhancing medication delivery methods is liposomes. Liposomes have a lot of promise to be widely used in cancer treatment [71]. The capacity to target cancer tissues, reduced clearance rates, biocompatibility, minimal toxicity, and controlled drug release are some of these structures\u2019 key features. By using free drugs instead of traditional chemotherapy, liposomes provide several bene\ufb01ts. Liposomes may be classi\ufb01ed into many categories based on their composition, size, lamellar number, mor- phology, and other characteristics. Clinical applications for these systems include improved vaccines, therapies, and diagnostics. Due to their unique characteristics, liposomes can be useful in the", "ristics, liposomes can be useful in the", "therapeutic domains of drug and gene delivery. Investigations on the potential use of liposomes in the treatment of several illnesses yielded some encouraging \ufb01ndings. Cancer is the most common of these illnesses. In this sense, these structures surveyed both chemo- therapy and imaging. 560 Rajesh Sudhakar Wakchaure et al. 12 Barcode Medication Administration (BCMA) It is advised to use barcode medication administration (BCMA) to reduce medication administration errors (MAEs) [72] because it enables nurses to con\ufb01rm the patient, drug, time, route, and dose\u2014 the \ufb01ve rights of medicine administration. Studies using observa- tional data on BCMA technology found that the incidence of MAEs decreased by 23% [73] to 56% [74]. After a BCMA system is put in place, mistakes are said to have decreased by as much as 80% [75, 76]. The BCMA technique works well to lower severe MAEs. This discovery is in line with other research \ufb01ndings, which showed that the majority of drug mistakes had no impact on patients\u2019 health [77]. This study\u2019s primary contribution is the \ufb01rst evidence of its kind, showing that a BCMA system can lower the incidence of MAEs in patients at a day hospital specializing in onco- hematology. The BCMA method lessens mistakes\u2019 real and pro- spective severity. Order of administration, pharmacy department medication transcribing, dose omissions, and dose mistakes were all successfully decreased by a BCMA system. Furthermore, BCMA technology has to be enhanced to reduce commonly found mis- takes and evaluate high potential errors, including the rate of infusion and the administration method. The advancement of tech- nology has the potential to enhance patient safety. 13 Estrogen Therapy and Bisphosphonates Microarchitectural degeneration and brittle bones are the hallma", "rrors, including the rate of infusion and the administration method. The advancement of tech- nology has the potential to enhance patient safety. 13 Estrogen Therapy and Bisphosphonates Microarchitectural degeneration and brittle bones are the hallmarks of osteoporosis, which results in around nine million bone fractures annually [78]. Selective estrogen receptor modulators, bisphospho- nates, and estrogen therapy are the mainstays of current therapeutic therapies for osteoporosis. However, there were clear limitations to these therapies, such as a lackluster therapeutic response and long- term safety concerns. The three primary clinical therapies for oste- oporosis now in use are selective estrogen receptor modulators, bisphosphonates, and estrogen therapy. However, there were clear limitations to these therapies, such as a lackluster therapeutic response and long-term safety concerns. For instance, bisphospho- nates were frequently used as osteoporosis treatments to prevent more bone loss. But it is unable to replace bone that has already been removed [79]. Rapid intravenous infusion of bisphosphonates", "might result in renal toxicity, while oral bisphosphonates can irritate the esophagus. Some non-skeletal side effects of estrogen treatment included vascular incidents and breast cancer [80]. Growth factors, calcitonin, parathyroid hormone, calcium, and vitamin D supple- ments are a few more pharmacological therapies for osteoporosis. Among these, supplementing with calcium and vitamin D to treat osteoporosis is a contentious treatment [81]. It has been documen- ted that calcitonin can cause gastrointestinal and vascular problems [82], and parathyroid hormone has the potential to result in fatal hypercalcemia [83]. Ethical and Safety Considerations in Drug Delivery Systems 561 14 Hydrogels Hydrogels are a type of material possessing special physical qualities that enable them to be used in many different biological applica- tions [84, 85]. Hydrogels have also been extensively employed in tissue engineering as scaffolds [86] or restorative medicine [87], in diagnostics [88], as membranes for the separation of biomolecules [89], or as a matrix for the encapsulation, delivery, and release of medicines [90]. Hydrogels\u2019 primary attributes, including their high-water content, high porosity, high deformability, and mold- ability, as well as their adaptability\u2014most of which can be simply adjusted by varying the degree of cross linking\u2014represent signi\ufb01- cant bene\ufb01ts that support their use in biomedicine [91]. Numerous chitosan-based hydrogels have been employed in the development of drug delivery systems for various modes of administration like oral [92], ocular [93], vaginal [94], or buccal [95] and for other illnesses, such as cancer, which ranks four among the world\u2019s top 10 causes of mortality [96]. Because hydrogels may extend the half- life of drugs and provide \ufb02exibility ", "ration like oral [92], ocular [93], vaginal [94], or buccal [95] and for other illnesses, such as cancer, which ranks four among the world\u2019s top 10 causes of mortality [96]. Because hydrogels may extend the half- life of drugs and provide \ufb02exibility in terms of dosage and rate of release, the scienti\ufb01c community was particularly interested in the development of anticancer drug delivery systems based on these materials [97]. Hydrogel-based drug delivery systems are also appropriate for the curative or palliative treatment of signi\ufb01cant gastrointestinal and gynecological cancers, such as peritoneal carci- nomatosis, since they may be administered locally [98]. 15 Oral Drug Delivery Due to bene\ufb01ts including patient choice, cost-effectiveness, ease of large-scale manufacture of oral dosage forms, and comfort of drug administration via the oral route, oral medicine is the most often used method of drug administration. Approximately 60% of well-known small-molecule pharmaceutical drugs that are sold commercially are taken orally. According to current estimates, oral formulations account for about 90% of all pharmaceutical", "formulations sold worldwide that are meant for human consump- tion. Approximately 84% of the most popular pharmaceutical drugs are taken orally, and their current market worth is $35 billion, growing at a pace of 10% each year [99]. Notwithstanding these bene\ufb01ts, there are still a number of dif\ufb01culties in creating oral formulations, which are mostly related to the physicochemical characteristics of medications, such as their low water solubility and membrane permeability. Physiological obstacles such as pH, ef\ufb02ux transporters, and metabolic enzymes, along with the poor chemical and biological stability of medications, can also restrict their absorption. Moreover, certain medications might induce nau- sea and localized discomfort [100]. 562 Rajesh Sudhakar Wakchaure et al. 16 Inhaled Corticosteroids (ICSs) For the treatment of long-term respiratory conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are commonly utilized. These drugs function by lessening the in\ufb02ammatory mediators produced in the respiratory tract, so preventing or lessening mucus forma- tion, bronchoconstriction, and in\ufb02ammation. A number of techni- ques have been developed to enhance the effectiveness and optimize the delivery of ICS. Using spacer devices is one strategy that helps to enhance pharmaceutical deposition in the lungs by slowing down the rate of medication administration [101]. Creat- ing more effective ICS formulations, including \ufb01ne-particle ICSs, which have demonstrated increased effectiveness when compared to traditional ICS formulations, is a further strategy [102]. 17 Novel Biologicals A family of medications known as biologicals, which are made from live cells or organisms, has completely changed how many respira- tory condition", "veness when compared to traditional ICS formulations, is a further strategy [102]. 17 Novel Biologicals A family of medications known as biologicals, which are made from live cells or organisms, has completely changed how many respira- tory conditions are treated, including idiopathic pulmonary \ufb01brosis (IPF), asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Biologicals provide a more focused and ef\ufb01cient form of therapy than conventional drugs by targeting certain proteins and immune cells that contribute to lung and airway in\ufb02ammation and damage [103]. The successful administration of biologicals to the lungs is essential to their effectiveness. Innovative techniques have been created to enhance the administration of drugs, such as intra- venous infusions, dry powder inhalers, and nebulizers [104]. Addi- tionally, new opportunities for targeted medication administration to certain lung regions have been made possible by recent devel- opments in nanotechnology [105]. Creating new drug delivery methods for targeted cancer treatment is an important area of", "oncology research and innovation. These systems aim to minimize adverse effects while increasing the ef\ufb01cacy of cancer therapies. The following are some important goals and factors to keep in mind: Ethical and Safety Considerations in Drug Delivery Systems 563 17.1 Targeted Drug Delivery Create carriers or nanoparticles that have the ability to identify and attach to antigens or markers unique to disease in order to create drug delivery systems that selectively target cancer cells while pre- serving healthy tissues. 17.2 Improved Drug Stability Make sure that cancer medications are more stable in the delivery system so that they may be transported and released at the tumor site without losing their effectiveness. 17.3 Controlled Release Create delivery methods that enable medication release at the tumor site that is both sustained and under control. In doing so, systemic toxicity can be reduced while increasing medication expo- sure to cancer cells. 17.4 Safety and Biocompatibility Make sure the medication delivery method is both safe and bio- compatible with human usage. To evaluate any potential harmful consequences, carry out thorough testing. 17.5 Customization Examine the potential for adjusting medication delivery methods to the unique characteristics of each patient, taking into account variables such as cancer stage, tumor kind, and genetics. 17.6 Multimodal Therapy To improve treatment success, research should be done on the creation of systems that can provide many therapeutic agents at once, such as immunotherapies, gene therapies, or chemotherapeu- tic medications. 17.7 Reducing Resistance To combat medication resistance, create delivery methods that can neutralize or circumvent the resistance mechanisms used by cancer cells. 17.8 Imaging and Monitoring To t", "s, gene therapies, or chemotherapeu- tic medications. 17.7 Reducing Resistance To combat medication resistance, create delivery methods that can neutralize or circumvent the resistance mechanisms used by cancer cells. 17.8 Imaging and Monitoring To track medication distribution and treatment response in real time, incorporate imaging and monitoring components into the delivery system. 17.9 Biodegradability Create drug delivery methods that are both biodegradable and easily eliminated from the body after administration, hence mini- mizing long-term adverse effects. 17.10 Scale-Up and Manufacturing To guarantee these delivery systems\u2019 accessibility and affordability for broad usage, develop scalable manufacturing procedures.", "564 Rajesh Sudhakar Wakchaure et al. 17.11 Regulatory Compliance Prior to clinical usage, make sure the drug delivery systems pass stringent safety and effectiveness testing and satisfy regulatory requirements. 17.12 Cooperation To expedite the development and approval process, promote coop- eration among researchers, physicians, pharmaceutical businesses, and regulatory agencies. 17.13 Patient Access Take steps to remove infrastructural and \ufb01nancial barriers in order to make these cutting-edge treatments available to a larger range of patients. 17.14 Clinical Studies To evaluate the ef\ufb01cacy of these innovative medication\u2019s delivery methods in practical situations, conduct carefully planned clinical studies. 17.15 Outreach and Education Using these innovative delivery methods, inform patients, health- care professionals, and the general public about the advantages and possible hazards of targeted treatments. 17.16 Ethical Considerations Talk about the moral implications of using new technology in treatment, patient permission, and data protection. 17.17 Constant Innovation Keep abreast of the most recent developments in the industry and keep coming up with new ideas to enhance the ef\ufb01cacy and security of medication delivery systems for treatment. 17.18 Multidisciplinary Strategy A multidisciplinary strategy including specialists from many domains like chemistry, pharmacology, nanotechnology, and oncology is necessary to achieve these goals. For the purpose of creating innovative drug delivery systems that have the potential to greatly in\ufb02uence the course of cancer therapy, cooperation and continuous research are crucial. 18 Conclusion Advances in drug delivery systems are crucial to addressing the twin issues of targeted treatment and controlled drug release, both of wh", "to greatly in\ufb02uence the course of cancer therapy, cooperation and continuous research are crucial. 18 Conclusion Advances in drug delivery systems are crucial to addressing the twin issues of targeted treatment and controlled drug release, both of which play signi\ufb01cant roles in maximizing treatment ef\ufb01cacy while minimizing side effects. With technologies like nanoparticles, nanocarriers, and smart drug delivery systems, researchers are developing solutions that can precisely target diseased cells and ensure regulated drug release, making treatments for complex diseases\u2014such as cancer, chronic respiratory conditions, and auto- immune disorders\u2014more effective. Alongside other emerging technologies like arti\ufb01cial intelligence and machine learning,", "nanomedicine has rede\ufb01ned possibilities in drug delivery, offering a tailored approach that could reshape patient outcomes. Ethical and Safety Considerations in Drug Delivery Systems 565 However, alongside these innovations, the challenge of medi- cation shortages looms large, especially as healthcare systems worldwide struggle with shortages in critical drug supplies, includ- ing essential vaccines and antimicrobial agents. These shortages not only disrupt patient care but also hinder clinical research and the practice of evidence-based medicine, creating a global public health concern. To mitigate these issues, it is imperative to advance regu- latory measures, improve manufacturing practices, and foster global cooperation. Through continuous research, cross- disciplinary collaboration, and robust regulatory frameworks, drug delivery innovations can better address both therapeutic ef\ufb01- cacy and drug accessibility, ultimately enhancing patient health worldwide.

Advances in pharmacology and pharmacokinetics underscore the critical role of drug release in determining therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy, leading to the development of controlled-release formulations since the 1950s. Controlled-release systems offer substantial advantages over conventional drugs, releasing medications at predetermined rates and durations, independent of physiological conditions, and providing spatial control over drug delivery. These systems improve drug solubility, target site accumulation, ef\ufb01cacy, pharmacokinetic properties, patient acceptance, compliance, and reduce drug toxic- ity. Next-generation drug delivery systems integrate cutting-edge advancements in material science, nanotechnology, biotechnology, and engineering, offering tailored solutions to overcome these hurdles. By leveraging novel formulations and sophisticated deliv- ery mechanisms, researchers aim to achieve precise control over drug release kinetics, optimizing therapeutic outcomes and mini- mizing systemic toxicity [30]. Active targeting strategies address these shortcomings by attaching ligands or molecules to carriers that bind speci\ufb01cally to target tissues, reducing off-target effects and toxicity. Responsive stimuli targeting further re\ufb01nes delivery precision by leveraging physical or chemical properties such as pH, ultrasound, temperature, magnetic, and electric \ufb01elds. Beyond improving targeting and permeability, the future of drug delivery will also focus on developing next-generation long-acting delivery technologies to optimize pharmacokinetics and achieve prepro- gramed pulsatile release over extended periods [39]. Moreover, integrating smart materials and nanoscale devices enables the devel- opment of responsive drug carriers capable of stimuli-triggered release or real-time", "rmacokinetics and achieve prepro- gramed pulsatile release over extended periods [39]. Moreover, integrating smart materials and nanoscale devices enables the devel- opment of responsive drug carriers capable of stimuli-triggered release or real-time monitoring of therapeutic levels. These advanced delivery platforms aim to enhance targeting ef\ufb01ciency at both the tissue and cellular levels, while also increasing the delivery of molecules through biological barriers such as the brain, intestine, and lung. These innovations not only enhance the ef\ufb01cacy and safety pro\ufb01les of medications but also pave the way for personalized medicine approaches tailored to individual patient needs. However, alongside these advancements come signi\ufb01cant challenges and complexities. Issues such as scalability, regulatory considerations, biocompatibility, and long-term safety pro\ufb01les necessitate meticu- lous evaluation and interdisciplinary collaboration. Addressing these challenges will be crucial for translating promising concepts into clinically viable solutions that can meet the diverse demands of modern healthcare. 572 Lipika Sarma et al. This review inspects the current landscape of next-generation drug delivery systems, highlights recent advancements, and dis- cusses the key challenges and future directions that will shape the evolution of this \ufb01eld.

Non-speci\ufb01c distribution of drugs can lead to off-target effects, reduced therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy, and increased toxicity. This is particularly crucial in treatments for conditions like cancer, where targeted delivery to tumor cells without affecting healthy cells is essential. Targeted drug delivery methods aim to minimize toxicity and improve treatment ef\ufb01cacy by directing med- ications to speci\ufb01c sites within the body. However, ensuring these methods effectively reach their intended targets remains uncertain. For instance, when administering siRNA systemically, its ability to reach target cells or organs is hindered by enzymatic degradation in the body. Furthermore, high doses can exacerbate the issue due to the molecules\u2019 negative charge, which impedes cellular absorption [62]. Lipid nanoparticles like micelles and liposomes are being checked for their potential to enhance targeted drug delivery. Yet, they face challenges such as interactions with the body\u2019s immune system, including phagocytic absorption and hepatic \ufb01ltration, which may hinder successful delivery and possibly lead to toxicity [142]. Additionally, issues such as patient unconsciousness, low solubility and permeability at the target site, interactions with food, and susceptibility to degradation by gastrointestinal \ufb02ora further complicate the achievement of effective targeted drug deliv- ery [43]. The kidneys and liver possess inherent mechanisms to detoxify the body, treating nanoparti", "teractions with food, and susceptibility to degradation by gastrointestinal \ufb02ora further complicate the achievement of effective targeted drug deliv- ery [43]. The kidneys and liver possess inherent mechanisms to detoxify the body, treating nanoparticles as waste products. This natural function can impede drug delivery and cause nanoparticles to accumulate in these organs. In the liver, nanomaterials primarily gather in Kupffer cells, sinusoidal endothelial cells, hepatic stellate cells, and, to a lesser extent, hepatocytes. Conversely, the charge, size, and shape of nanoparticles determine their fate in the renal system once they enter it [15]. Achieving systemic targeting through nanoparticles is challenging because their clearance by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) and subsequent accumulation in the liver [17]. Unlike small-molecule drugs where conjugation with targeting ligands, as seen with clinically successful antibody\u2013 drug conjugates like trastuzumab, enables systemic targeting, simi- lar active targeting strategies are often ineffective for nanoparticles due to the deposition of protein corona [108]. This obstacle also hinders ef\ufb01cient gene delivery in tissues outside the liver.", "574 Lipika Sarma et al.

However, many promising nanomaterials, such as certain nanopar- ticles, can induce immune responses or accumulate in organs, leading to adverse effects. Ensuring the safety of these materials over long-term use is a major concern. [117]. Research involving silver, gold, silica, and titanium nanoparticles used for drug cou- pling and delivery has demonstrated their harmful impacts in both in vivo and in vitro settings [113]. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have ", "use is a major concern. [117]. Research involving silver, gold, silica, and titanium nanoparticles used for drug cou- pling and delivery has demonstrated their harmful impacts in both in vivo and in vitro settings [113]. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have gained popularity in gene therapy, bio-imaging, and drug delivery as their ability to traverse cell membranes when employed as bio- molecule carriers [103, 141]. Despite their promising attributes, concerns persist among researchers regarding their potential toxic- ity to embryos, genes, liver, heart, neurons, and the immune sys- tem, particularly when applied in drug delivery contexts [113]. It is crucial to conduct rigorous toxicity testing before widespread adoption in treatment protocols. The biocompatibility and", "acceptability of DDS pose signi\ufb01cant challenges, as the body\u2019s response to biological materials differs markedly from synthetic ones [117]. Moreover, natural barriers like the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which restricts therapeutic drug access to brain tissues, further complicate the effective treatment of cerebral diseases [26]. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), forming immunoliposomes by binding to liposomal surfaces, are extensively used as carriers but face limitations due to potential immune responses and insuf\ufb01cient absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination by the body, hampering their ef\ufb01cacy as targeted drug carriers [120]. 576 Lipika Sarma et al. 3.3 Controlled Release Achieving exact control over the release rate of drugs is vital to maintaining therapeutic levels within the body. Various factors, including the physiological environment and the nature of the drug, in\ufb02uence release kinetics. Designing delivery systems that can respond to speci\ufb01c biological stimuli to release drugs at the right time and place remains complex. Long-acting formulations that sustain drug release are particularly important for treating chronic conditions requiring extended therapy, especially in low-resource healthcare settings where access to frequent medical care may be limited. Currently, there are 63 FDA-approved long- acting drug products available, with 22 of these utilizing biode- gradable formulations [73]. Non-biodegradable implants generally offer prolonged drug release compared to biodegradable inject- ables and implants, but they necessitate surgical removal post- treatment, presenting logistical challenges in resource-limited environments [95]. Biodegradable injectable formulations are desirable [37]; however, they often exhibit initial rapid release, which may n", "s, but they necessitate surgical removal post- treatment, presenting logistical challenges in resource-limited environments [95]. Biodegradable injectable formulations are desirable [37]; however, they often exhibit initial rapid release, which may not be suitable for drugs with narrow therapeutic ranges and could reduce the formulation\u2019s duration of effectiveness. Moreover, injectable long-acting formulations may not be appro- priate for hydrophilic drugs or biologics due to their tendency for rapid release [20]. 3.4 Stability of Drug Formulations Many drugs, especially biologics like proteins and peptides, are naturally unstable and may degrade before reaching their intended target. Protecting these drugs from enzymatic breakdown and maintaining their stability during storage and administration pose a persistent challenge. Factors such as cold and heat exposure, lyophilization, varying pH levels, concentrations, ionic strength, agitation, surface interactions, and container architecture all in\ufb02u- ence the stability of these therapeutic biomolecules. For instance, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), a crucial subset of protein drugs, are typically administered via repeated injections, either as solutions or suspensions, due to their poor oral bioavailability. This method is inconvenient, often requiring medical supervision or hospital visits, and is costly. mAbs and other protein drugs, attributable to their fragile structures, are prone to conformational changes during", "formulation and storage, potentially leading to loss of biological activity [25]. Factors like temperature variations, moisture levels, exposure to organic solvents, pH shifts, or enzymatic presence can cause structural modi\ufb01cations in peptides and proteins, possibly rendering them permanently inactive [9]. Changes in the environ- ment around drugs, such as temperature, hydration level, exposure to organic solvents, pH variations, or the presence of enzymes, can alter the structure of peptides and proteins, possibly deactivating them permanently. Most clotting factors maintain their effective- ness well until 24 h after collection when stored at 4 \u00b0C, although factor VIII typically experiences a 20\u201330% loss in activity during this time [93]. Introducing external proteins with new functions or using natural proteins in unconventional ways can effectively address speci\ufb01c issues in the body, even if these proteins are not typically found in those contexts. For instance, papain can degrade protein debris in wounds [19], collagenase can break down colla- gen in the necrotic tissue of wounds [106], and recombinant human DNase 1 can eliminate DNA from dying neutrophils in the respiratory tracts of cystic \ufb01brosis patients [38]. However, ther- apeutic enzymes uses face signi\ufb01cant challenges due to their insta- bility and short lifespan in circulation. The body\u2019s temperature, pH levels, and salinity are often not optimal for microbial enzymes, which can lead to their denaturation [44]. Enzymes typically degrade quickly at room temperature, and this process accelerates at the body\u2019s normal temperature of 37 \u00b0C. The activity of native proteolytic enzymes and rejection by the immune system also play crucial roles in determining the long-term effectiveness and stabil- ity of external", "ture, and this process accelerates at the body\u2019s normal temperature of 37 \u00b0C.

Nanocarriers like liposomes, dendrimers, and polymeric nanoparticles are promising tools for targeted as well as controlled drug release. These sub-micron particles boast a large surface area, allowing for higher drug loading and improved bioavailability com- pared to free drugs alone [27]. They can be exactly directed to speci\ufb01c cell types and even cellular regions such as the nucleus, enhancing intracellular drug delivery [22]. Nanocarriers effectively overcome anatomical barriers like the blood-brain barrier, facilitat- ing treatment of central nervous system diseases [90]. Their ability to target remote tissues, including crossing biological barriers, has made them increasingly popular in drug delivery systems [126]. Innovative approaches such as cell therapies are seen as poten- tial solutions to enhance the acceptability of drug delivery systems to minimize drug accumulation [126]. Priming agents, which modify tissue environments to optimize drug ef\ufb01cacy without adverse effects, are also suggested to improve delivery outcomes [61]. The integration of cells with nano biomaterials presents a novel yet theoretical method to enhance drug delivery, leveraging the compatibility of cells within the human body [61]. Gao et al. [41] developed a nanobomb labeled as RGD@HCuS (VA) that targets tumor vascular endothelium. Upon exposure to near- infrared (NIR) laser irradiation in vitro, the localized temperature increase triggers the rapid release of nitrogen (N2) bubbles from the nanoparticles. These bubbles then detonate instantly, leading to t", "vascular endothelium. Upon exposure to near- infrared (NIR) laser irradiation in vitro, the localized temperature increase triggers the rapid release of nitrogen (N2) bubbles from the nanoparticles. These bubbles then detonate instantly, leading to the destruction of neovascularization and causing necrosis of adja- cent tumor cells. The surface modi\ufb01cation of nanoparticles with RGD peptide enables speci\ufb01c binding to \u03b1v\u03b23 receptors on vascular endothelium, ensuring precise eradication of tumor neovasculari- zation while sparing normal tissues from damage. While these advancements hold promise, further clinical trials and research are essential to re\ufb01ne and overcome existing challenges in modern drug delivery systems. 4.2 Smart Drug Delivery Systems Smart drug delivery systems (SDDSs) are designed to respond selectively to speci\ufb01c physiological conditions like pH, temperature, or speci\ufb01c enzymes, thereby triggering the release of therapeutic agents. Current research aims to enhance these systems to achieve on-demand drug release, which could signi\ufb01cantly improve treat- ment outcomes for diseases such as diabetes and cancer. SDDSs are engineered to pile up favorably at diseased tissue sites, enabling controlled drug release tailored to the pathological environment. This targeted approach optimizes therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy by ensuring drugs are released at the right location and dosage over the required duration, thereby maximizing therapeutic concentration", "within a safe window while minimizing adverse effects on healthy tissues. To achieve these goals, SDDSs must be biocompatible and biodegradable, ensuring they penetrate tissues and cells without causing toxicity, immunogenicity, or unintended accumulation in non-target organs. Various carriers such as micelles, liposomes, meso-porous silica nanoparticles (MSNs), gold nanoparticles, den- drimers, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), quantum dots (QDs), vitamins like folic acid (B9) [105] and biotin (B7), and monoclonal anti- bodies have been explored extensively for their potential in pre- cisely delivering medications to speci\ufb01c and targeted locations. [63]. Many anticancer drugs are typically administered at their maximum tolerated doses, often causing severe cytotoxic side effects in cancer patients, which limits their treatment options. Smart drug delivery systems (SDDSs) offer a solution by enabling effective intracellular drug concentrations at lower doses, thereby widening the therapeutic window of anticancer medications. SDDSs provide several bene\ufb01ts, including enhanced speci\ufb01c target- ing of diseased tissues, improved patient adherence, reduced toxic- ity, and controlled distribution throughout the body [91]. Here are three mechanisms of action of smart drug delivery systems: 580 Lipika Sarma et al. \u2022 Active Targeting Delivery Systems: This approach involves attach- ing antibodies, antibody fragments, or peptides to drugs or drug carriers. These components act as targeting ligands, guiding the delivery system to speci\ufb01c receptor structures expressed on cells in the target region. This active homing mechanism enhances the accumulation of drugs at the intended site, improving treat- ment ef\ufb01cacy while minimizing systemic exposure. \u2022 Passive Targeting Delivery Systems: Passive", " structures expressed on cells in the target region. This active homing mechanism enhances the accumulation of drugs at the intended site, improving treat- ment ef\ufb01cacy while minimizing systemic exposure. \u2022 Passive Targeting Delivery Systems: Passive targeting relies on the physiological and biochemical characteristics of tissues to achieve drug accumulation. Factors such as enhanced retention and permeability (EPR) effect in tumors or differential pH con- ditions between healthy and diseased tissues can cause drug carriers to accumulate selectively at speci\ufb01c sites. This approach leverages natural physiological processes to improve drug deliv- ery ef\ufb01ciency without the need for active targeting ligands [29]. \u2022 Triggered Release Systems: Smart drug delivery systems can be planned to respond to speci\ufb01c stimuli such as pH, or light, temperature, and enzymes. These stimuli set off the release of the encapsulated drug at the desired location or time, improving the precision and ef\ufb01cacy of treatment while minimizing off-target effects. This controlled release mechanism secure that therapeutic agents are delivered precisely where and when they are needed most [11].", "Challenges and Future Directions for Next-Generation Drug Delivery Systems 581 Stimuli-responsive smart drug delivery systems can be categor- ized into two types: Exogenous Stimuli-Responsive SDDSs (Open-Loop System) These systems are externally controlled and are often referred to as open- loop systems. They utilize external triggers such as magnets, tem- perature changes, ultrasound waves, or electric \ufb01elds to activate drug release mechanisms [134]. Endogenous Stimuli-Responsive SDDSs (Closed-Loop System) Also known as self-regulating or responsive medication delivery systems, these operate within a closed-loop control framework. They respond to internal physiological triggers such as pH levels, enzyme activity, or redox conditions to regulate drug release in a self-adjusting manner [134]. These classi\ufb01cations highlight how stimuli-responsive smart drug delivery systems leverage either external or internal cues to enhance drug release precision and therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy, minimizing unintended side effects. 4.3 Gene Therapy and RNA-Based Therapies Gene therapy and RNA-based treatments, including mRNA vac- cines, have garnered considerable attention due to their potential in treating various diseases. Effective delivery of these therapies requires innovative carriers capable of safeguarding nucleic acids from damage and facilitating their uptake by target cells. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have appeared promise in this regard, although ongoing research aims to enhance their ef\ufb01ciency and safety. A newly developed delivery system based on CRISPR employs single-stranded RNA (sgRNA) and Cas9 endonuclease. Together, sgRNA and Cas9 guide the Cas9 protein to a speci\ufb01c target site based on RNA-DNA recognition. This targeting is mediated by CRISPR RNA (crRNA) sequences. However, e", "m based on CRISPR employs single-stranded RNA (sgRNA) and Cas9 endonuclease. Together, sgRNA and Cas9 guide the Cas9 protein to a speci\ufb01c target site based on RNA-DNA recognition. This targeting is mediated by CRISPR RNA (crRNA) sequences. However, efforts are underway to minimize off-target effects associated with the sgRNA-Cas9 complex. This mechanism can potentially be adapted for delivering various protein-based drugs beyond Cas9 [27]. To address challenges in effective RNA delivery, viral-vector-based and non-viral delivery systems were introduced. These systems protect RNA from degradation, optimize delivery to intended cells, and reduce exposure to unintended cells. While viral gene therapies have demonstrated clinical success in certain cases [67, 80, 101], their application can be constrained by issues such as pre-existing immunity, viral-induced immune responses, potential genomic integration, payload size limitations, the inability to administer repeated doses, challenges in scaling production, and high costs associated with vector manufacturing [8, 18, 23, 92, 136]. Recent advancements in synthetic materials used to encapsulate RNA, such as lipids, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), and polymers, have revitalized research into non-viral delivery systems. This progress has led to signi\ufb01cant milestones, including FDA approval of subcutaneously administered Nacetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)\u2013siRNA conjugates", "targeting hepatocytes [42, 107], intravenously administered LNP-based siRNA drugs also targeting hepatocytes [5], emergency use authorization (EUA), and FDA approval for intramuscularly administered LNP-based mRNA COVID vaccines [100]. These approvals indicate the potential for enhanced transport to non- liver (extrahepatic) tissues and localized delivery to critical sites such as the central nervous system, eye, and ear, potentially enabling the development of new drugs. mRNA-based therapies offer a versatile approach for treating many diseases, encompassing applications such as antigen production (including COVID-19 vaccines), protein replacement therapies, and genome engineering. In a notable 2021 study, researchers successfully utilized LNPs encapsulating Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 mRNA and a CRISPR guide RNA in six patients with hATTR amyloidosis with poly- neuropathy. A single dose of 0.3 mg/kg resulted in an average reduction of 87% in blood transthyretin (TTR) levels 28 days after administration. TTR is responsible for transporting vitamin A and thyroxine, and mutations in its gene lead to hATTR [45]. This milestone marks a signi\ufb01cant advancement in therapeutic modalities, coinciding with the remarkable success of the FDA-approved mRNA-based vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 [28]. 582 Lipika Sarma et al. In addition to gene replacement strategies, transient expression of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein has demonstrated immu- nological tolerance and subsequent treatment ef\ufb01cacy in experi- mental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models in mice [68]. mRNA vaccines studies have focused on various viruses such as Zika [75], HIV [70], in\ufb02uenza [33], and diseases like melanoma [109]. Currently, gene delivery systems primarily involve viral vec- tors and non-viral vectors [79", "itis models in mice [68]. mRNA vaccines studies have focused on various viruses such as Zika [75], HIV [70], in\ufb02uenza [33], and diseases like melanoma [109]. Currently, gene delivery systems primarily involve viral vec- tors and non-viral vectors [79, 111, 114]. Viral vector systems include retroviruses [116], adenoviruses (AdV) [59], adeno- associated viruses (AAV) [81, 104], lentiviruses (LV) [115], and bacteriophages, among others. Most of the gene therapy drugs currently available on the market utilize viral vectors. Despite their drawbacks such as high immunogenicity, safety concerns, and complex production processes, viral vectors offer superior transfection ef\ufb01ciency, which is a distinct advantage for gene deliv- ery. Researchers prefer non-viral vectors because of their ability to accommodate large gene payloads, high safety, and low immuno- genicity, pro\ufb01les suitable for bulk production. Commonly utilized non-viral carriers include cationic liposomes, micelles [140], poly- mers, and inorganic nanoparticles. The emergence of biomaterials has given rise to innovative nanocarriers such as DNA nanoclews [121], metal-organic frameworks [1], and cell membranes [86]. As research progresses, these modi\ufb01ed nanocarriers demonstrate enhanced performance, improving both drug loading capacity and gene therapy ef\ufb01cacy, while also offering superior biological safety and targeting capabilities compared to viral vectors. There- fore, identifying suitable carriers for gene therapy drugs is crucial to overcoming delivery challenges [98]. In a study by [135] RNAi", "8]. In a study by [135] RNAi", "technology was employed to silence the proto-oncogenes PIK3CA and PIK3CB in human colon and rectal cancer (CRC). The \ufb01nd- ings suggest that targeting PIK3CA and PIK3CB could serve as potential therapeutic strategies for CRC, potentially mitigating chemotherapy resistance and offering personalized treatment options for patients. Challenges and Future Directions for Next-Generation Drug Delivery Systems 583 4.4 Personalized Medicine The integration of drug delivery systems with personalized medi- cine approaches offers a future direction for tailored therapies. Advances in genomics and biomarker identi\ufb01cation can enable the design of delivery systems that are customized to an individual\u2019s genetic pro\ufb01le, leading to more effective and personalized treat- ments. The variability in disease presentation among patients, cou- pled with individual physiological differences, underscores the need for personalized treatment approaches. For instance, not all indivi- duals with conditions like type 2 in\ufb02ammation asthma or in\ufb02am- matory bowel disease respond uniformly to the same biologic therapies [110, 124]. Similarly, the heterogeneous nature of tumors among patients can lead to varying effectiveness of treat- ments within different subsets of the population. Efforts are under- way to develop therapies tailored to each patient\u2019s speci\ufb01c needs. Future progress in drug delivery systems for individualized medi- cine must account for these patient-speci\ufb01c variabilities. Key con- siderations include the patient\u2019s age (child, adult, elderly), whether a sustained-release or pulsatile-release formulation is required, the patient\u2019s lifestyle factors, and variations in biological barriers across different individuals. Recently, techniques such as machine learning and proteomics analysis, inc", " whether a sustained-release or pulsatile-release formulation is required, the patient\u2019s lifestyle factors, and variations in biological barriers across different individuals. Recently, techniques such as machine learning and proteomics analysis, including proteograph methods, have been applied to analyze engineered nanoparticles\u2019 interactions with protein coronas in plasma. This approach enables deep and large-scale pro\ufb01ling of protein variants among patients, aiding in the customization of therapeutic strategies [34]. Future advance- ments in DDS require comprehensive evaluation to understand how their physical and chemical properties affect the traversal of biological barriers in distinct disease subtypes and patient popula- tions, enabling the development of personalized treatment strate- gies. For instance, variations in vascular physiology among patients signi\ufb01cantly in\ufb02uence the distribution and effectiveness of systemi- cally administered nanoparticles [84]. Similarly, mechanical loading within knee joints can impact the performance of intra-articular drug delivery systems, with differences observed between patients at early versus late stages of osteoarthritis, re\ufb02ecting variations in physical activity levels [40]. The design criteria for future drug delivery systems must account for such diverse factors. Ultimately, there is a need for modular drug delivery platforms capable of tailoring speci\ufb01c therapies to individual patient subtypes.", "584 Lipika Sarma et al. 4.5 Bioinspired and Biomimetic Systems Bioinspired and biomimetic drug delivery systems, which mimic natural biological processes and structures, hold great potential. These systems can enhance biocompatibility and targeting preci- sion. For example, using cell membranes to camou\ufb02age nanoparti- cles can improve their circulation time and targeting abilities. Biomimetic principles are utilized to assess the functionality of carriers and develop innovative methods for their preparation [7]. Bioinspired systems, which mimic natural components of the body, offer versatility and innovation. Examples include employing natural biological nanotopographies for various purposes: viruses use nanoneedles to inject genomic material into cells, gecko feet, and pollen utilize nanostructured surfaces for enhanced adhesion, ciliated epithelial barriers regulate transport, and insect wings pre- vent bacterial infections using antimicrobial nanopillars and nanos- pikes [14, 56, 78, 97]. Such bioinspired drug carriers \ufb01nd applications in diverse \ufb01elds such as cancer immunotherapy, gene editing, treatment of vascular diseases, and combating antibiotic- resistant infections [24, 85, 132]. Numerous nanotopographical products with clinical potential have emerged, including Nano+ (Lepu Medical), a nanotopographical stent loaded with sirolimus for treating coronary artery disease, and SLActive (Straumann Group) dental implants designed for improved osseointegration. Additionally, commercialized products like the NanoForticore spi- nal implant (Nanovis), featuring nanotube functionality, are cur- rently undergoing preclinical investigations [51, 69]. Nanostructured thin \ufb01lms, \ufb01brous mats, and patches represent widely utilized nanotopographical materials for drug delivery.

These materials consist of a \ufb02at substrate adorned with three-dimensional nanotopographic features such as pores, \ufb01bers, pillars, or needles [46]. Films and patches can be fabricated from various materials, including inorganic substances like silica, as well as \ufb02exible materials such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and polycaprolactone (PCL) [94, 133]. These technologies enable the development of wearable devices equipped with gecko-inspired bio-adhesive nanotopography [94]. Currently, there is a trend toward utilizing cells, their membranes, or vesicles as nanoscale carriers for bionanomimetic modi\ufb01cations in targeted therapy for challenging diseases. This approach aims to create natural membrane-bionanomimetic drug delivery systems (DDS), includ- ing exosome-like porous silicon nanoparticles, neutrophil membrane-modi\ufb01ed nanoparticles [143], and red blood cell membrane-encapsulated magnetic nanotherapeutics [131]. These strategies reduce the body\u2019s immune rejection response and evade capture by macrophages and reticuloendothelial cells [72]. Bioin- spired DDS research center extensively on designing and enhancing the ef\ufb01cacy of bioactive vehicles, particularly through nanoparticle technologies [31].", "Challenges and Future Directions for Next-Generation Drug Delivery Systems 585 4.6 3D Printing and Microfabrication 3D printing and microfabrication technologies offer new avenues for creating complex and customizable drug delivery devices. These technologies allow for exact control over the design and fabrication of delivery systems, enabling the production of structures with intricate geometries and functions. In 2015, the FDA approved Spritam\u00ae (levetiracetam), marking the advent of pharmacoprinting in pharmaceutical manufacturing [32]. Three-dimensional-printed drug delivery methods have garnered interest in both tissue engi- neering and pharmaceutical applications attributable to construct systems using multiple materials and their unique capability to print complex physiological structures and organs. Recent evolution in 3D printing tool enables the customization of personalized medi- cations, enhancing therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy through drug-eluting implants, printlets (3D-printed tablets), tailored medical devices with speci\ufb01c doses, shapes, sizes, and release pro\ufb01les [55, 119]. Three-dimensional printing (3DP) is a manufacturing method that creates 3D objects using digital models by layering or depositing materials sequentially, allowing for the fabrication of objects with diverse geometries in a layer-by-layer approach. This process, otherwise called rapid prototyping, or solid free-form fabrication, additive manufacturing [47], encompasses various technologies applicable in pharmaceutical contexts. These include inkjet-based printing systems, nozzle-based deposition systems, and laser-based writing systems [88], each further categorized based on the materials and energy sources utilized. 4.7 Applications of 3D Printed Oral, Rectal, and Vaginal Drug Delivery in Pharma", "sed printing systems, nozzle-based deposition systems, and laser-based writing systems [88], each further categorized based on the materials and energy sources utilized. 4.7 Applications of 3D Printed Oral, Rectal, and Vaginal Drug Delivery in Pharmaceutics Research into 3D printing in pharmaceutical applications has high- lighted its potential for creating personalized drug formulations tailored to speci\ufb01c delivery routes. For instance, Lim et al. [74] utilized an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene \ufb01lament to print a carbamazepine-loaded oral device designed for tonic seizures, ensuring a stable and biodegradable platform [74]. This device achieved zero-order drug release kinetics for antiepileptic drugs, enhancing patient adherence by delivering effective therapeutic doses while minimizing side effects. Similarly, Hsu et al. demon- strated the capability of 3D printing to create solid dispersions with accurate control over the dosage of active pharmaceutical constitu- ent [54]. Their study employed polyethylene glycol (PEG), known for its favorable biodegradation properties, and naproxen as a model drug. The resulting drug delivery system exhibited uniform composition and sustained-release characteristics, including gastric resistance and pH-responsive drug release in phosphate and bicar- bonate buffers. The application of dual extrusion-based 3D print- ing enabled core-shell designs for delayed-release kinetics, particularly bene\ufb01cial for drugs with high water solubility and the development of gastric-resistant products. Despite its lower resolu- tion, FDM 3D printing has demonstrated effectiveness in the single-step fabrication of delayed-release tablets. This capability", "pite its lower resolu- tion, FDM 3D printing has demonstrated effectiveness in the single-step fabrication of delayed-release tablets. This capability", "underscores the dual FDM 3D printing\u2019s potential as a specialized platform for tailoring delayed-release tablets to meet the speci\ufb01c needs of individual patients. Piezoelectric inkjet printing, wherein drugs are mixed into a pre-polymer solution, offers immediate drug release pro\ufb01les facilitated by hydrophilic active materials, ensuring precise dosing [4]. Pharmaceutical-grade hydrophilic polymers like poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) or Eudragit\u00ae EPO are frequently employed in 3D printed drug devices designed for immediate drug release, as they dissolve rapidly upon contact with body \ufb02uids. To deliver drugs effectively to the intestine, formulations must withstand the acidic environment of the stomach while dissolving in the alkaline environment of the intestines. Goyanes et al. demon- strated that PVA-based capsules containing budesonide, coated with the enteric polymer Eudragit\u00ae L, can successfully deliver drugs via the oral route to the small intestine for treating in\ufb02am- matory bowel disease 6B) [48]. Okwuosa et al. employed a dual 3D printing extrusion method to create gastric-resistant devices loaded with theophylline, budesonide, and diclofenac sodium (Okwuosa et al. 2016). These oral devices were designed with a methacrylic acid copolymer forming the shell and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) comprising the core. The shell-core architecture demonstrated robust resistance to acidic conditions and initiated drug release within the core in alkaline environments, achieving up to 80% drug release within 8 hours.

Dissolution simulations mimicking the gastrointestinal tract showed sustained drug release unaffected by pH variations, indicating the potential of this 3D printing platform for pharmaceutical applications. Techno- logical developments in 3D printing recently have enabled the fabrication of patient-speci\ufb01c pharmaceuticals with complex, cus- tom shapes based on clinical data obtained from CT or MRI scans. This approach allows for the creation of implants that closely match the patient\u2019s anatomical features through CAD modeling, particu- larly enhancing the delivery of drugs with narrow therapeutic win- dows. For instance, Muwaffak et al. successfully printed patch- shaped structures that accurately mirrored the contour of a patient\u2019s nose using STL technology and facial scanning data [89]. 586 Lipika Sarma et al. Despite its numerous potential economic and medical advan- tages, the widespread application of 3D printing (3DP) technology in product commercialization faces several technical challenges. These include the limited availability of biocompatible materials suitable for 3DP printers, technical issues related to the stability of starting materials in pharmaco-technical processes, concerns regarding the capacity and reproducibility of 3DP processes, and the quality assurance of \ufb01nal products. Additionally, regulatory modi\ufb01cations and considerations must be de\ufb01ned to ensure the approval of pharmaceutical products manufactured using 3DP", "pharmaceutical products manufactured using 3DP", "methods. However, with continuous re\ufb01nement and innovation in 3DP techniques, many of these technical and regulatory hurdles are being addressed. As a result, 3DP technology is evolving rapidly and is expected to \ufb01nd broader applications in various drug delivery systems. This advancement is anticipated to facilitate the clinical implementation of personalized dosage forms that are more patient-friendly in the future. Challenges and Future Directions for Next-Generation Drug Delivery Systems 587 4.8 Microfabricated Drug Delivery Systems Microfabrication techniques like inkjet printing and micro\ufb02uidics enable the production of micro- and nano-scale drug delivery systems. Examples include microneedle arrays, microparticles, and micropatterns for drug delivery. Microfabricated systems can improve drug solubility, stability, and targeting compared to con- ventional formulations. For example, unlike the traditional method of mixing drug delivery vehicles with a drug suspension, the micromolding-based drug casting process offers a way to load concentrated drug formulations onto microfabricated structures easily using vacuum application [66]. 4.9 Next-Generation Drug Delivery for Chronic Diseases Future research should prioritize the development of novel long- acting injection compositions that reduce initial drug release and are suitable for delivering hydrophilic biologics and drugs. Long- acting delivery systems are also advancing through oral administra- tion. For example, weekly ingestible capsules containing antiretro- viral drugs and a star-shaped pill for memantine or risperidone ER have successfully demonstrated prolonged drug delivery via oral ingestion [65, 77].

Current commercial technologies like Diffucaps, Pulsincap, CODAS, PULSYSTM, and OROS offer pulsatile release capabilities but are mainly restricted to small- molecule drugs [83]. Recent studies have introduced microparti- cles capable of providing multiple vaccine doses over an extended duration with a single injection [110, 124]. Such approaches are advantageous for vaccines requiring multiple administrations, such as those for measles or COVID-19, bene\ufb01ting individuals with limited access to frequent medical care. Future developments in pulsatile drug delivery systems hold promise for achieving long- term release aligned with the rhythms of various chronic diseases. 4.10 Integrating Cutting-Edge Technologies with Pharmaceutical Delivery The incorporation of AI and big data has transformed the drug delivery \ufb01eld.

They play a role in re\ufb01ning the design of formulation spaces [ ]. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) represents a population-based optimization technique applicable in dosage form optimization. It has been employed effectively to enhance particle size distribution, dissolution pro\ufb01les, and various other parameters in formulations [ ], Arti\ufb01cial neural networks (ANNs) have been utilized for the modeling and enhancement of drug release kinetics across various dosage forms. They aid in identifying optimal formulations and forecasting the release char- acteristics of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) under diverse conditions [ ]. Additionally, AI-driven virtual applications can analyze an individual\u2019s health data, encompassing genetic informa- tion, medical history, lifestyle factors, and current health status, to devise personalized treatment strategies. Another promising ave- nue involves integrating drug delivery with electronics, sensors, chips, power sources (internal or external), and micro- or nano- robots. For instance, IntelliCap (AAPS) is an ingestible device that wirelessly transmits data, equipped with a motor for drug release, a microprocessor to regulate the pump, and sensors for monitoring pH and temperature [ ]. Another instance involves a robotic pill equipped with a liquid autoinjector, which has demonstrated an 80% increase in the absorption of biologics such as peptides or proteins when taken orally.

This capability would allow both doctors and patients to monitor and adjust the release pattern as necessary. For instance, a computer-based program wirelessly communicated to verify the correct functioning of a microchip for drug delivery, engineered speci\ufb01cally to administer microgram amounts of an antiosteoporo- sis medication once daily for up to three weeks [ , ]. AI enables the modeling of DDS at different scales, from molecular interac- tions to macroscopic behavior. This allows researchers to simulate and evaluate various scenarios, accelerating the timeline for drug development, reducing costs, and increasing productivity. AI can analyze complex relationships between drug properties, formula- tion components, and physiological factors to predict drug behav- ior, leading to a better understanding of DDS and the design of ef\ufb01cient drug delivery systems. Speci\ufb01c AI methodologies employed in drug delivery include supervised learning methods like k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, and arti\ufb01cial neural net- works. These are used for tasks such as predicting physicochemical properties, in vitro drug release pro\ufb01les, stability, pharmacokinetics, and drug-drug interactions [ ]. This highlights the potential of AI to revolutionize drug delivery and improve patient care.

Continued research and integration of AI with human expertise are necessary to fully realize the bene\ufb01ts of this technology. Challenges and Future Directions for Next-Generation Drug Delivery Systems 589 4.11 The Challenges in Integrating AI into Drug Delivery Systems Availability of Comprehensive Datasets One of the major issues is the limited availability of detailed databases with information on formulation components, drug properties, and physiological fac- tors needed to train robust AI models. Building large, high-quality datasets is crucial for developing effective AI-powered drug delivery systems [129]. Multidisciplinary Collaboration Promoting collaboration among researchers, clinicians, engineers, and data scientists is essen- tial for advancing AI-driven drug delivery systems. This multidisci- plinary approach combines domain knowledge, technical skills, and clinical insights to drive innovation and address challenges effec- tively ethical and regulatory considerations: The incorporation of AI in drug delivery raises ethical and regulatory concerns around data privacy, algorithmic bias, and accountability. Developing clear guidelines and frameworks to ensure the responsible and ethical use of AI is crucial for clinical translation [127]. Technical Limitations Challenges exist in training accurate AI models for complex drug delivery processes, accounting for factors like formulation composition, manufacturing processes, and physi- ological conditions. Further research and development efforts are necessary to overcome these technical limitations [127]. Cost and Scalability The high costs associated with implementing AI-powered systems and scaling them up for large-scale d", "hysi- ological conditions. Further research and development efforts are necessary to overcome these technical limitations [127]. Cost and Scalability The high costs associated with implementing AI-powered systems and scaling them up for large-scale drug manufacturing are barriers to widespread adoption. Strategies to improve cost-effectiveness and scalability are necessary. Despite these challenges, the potential bene\ufb01ts of AI in enhancing drug delivery systems, like improved ef\ufb01cacy, safety, and personali- zation, make it a promising area of research and development. Tackling these challenges via collaborative efforts and continued technological advancements will be crucial for realizing the full potential of AI in drug delivery. 5 Conclusion The next-generation DDS faces multifaceted challenges that neces- sitate innovative solutions for future advancements. Key challenges include accomplishing precise and regulated drug delivery, over- coming biological barriers, ensuring biocompatibility and safety,", "and optimizing scalability and cost-effectiveness. Addressing these challenges requires interdisciplinary collaborations integrating nanotechnology, biomaterials science, pharmacology, and engi- neering to design smart delivery platforms. Emerging technologies such as nanoparticles, liposomes, and biomimetic carriers offer promising avenues for enhancing drug stability, bioavailability, and speci\ufb01c tissue targeting. However, their translation into clinical applications requires rigorous preclinical evaluation and regulatory compliance to ensure ef\ufb01cacy and safety pro\ufb01les. Moreover, perso- nalized medicine approaches, leveraging advancements in genomics and proteomics, are shaping the development of tailored drug delivery systems to meet individual patient needs. Looking ahead, the future of next-generation DDS lies in harnessing arti\ufb01cial intel- ligence and machine learning for predictive modeling and optimiz- ing therapeutic outcomes. Additionally, the incorporation of stimuli-responsive materials and advanced imaging techniques holds potential for real-time monitoring and adaptive drug delivery. Collaborative efforts among academia, industry, and regulatory bodies are essential to expedite the translation of these innovations from bench to bedside. In conclusion, while signi\ufb01cant advance- ments have been achieved in advancing drug delivery technologies, ongoing research efforts are crucial to address current challenges and unlock the full potential of next-generation systems.

Part I: Physiological factors affecting therapeutic effectiveness of aerosolized medications N. R. Labiris & M. B. Dolovich Department of Medicine at McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada As the end organ for the treatment of local diseases or as the route of administration for systemic therapies, the lung is a very attractive target for drug delivery. It provides direct access to disease in the treatment of respiratory diseases, while providing an enormous surface area and a relatively low enzymatic, controlled environment for systemic absorption of medications. As a major port of entry, the lung has evolved to prevent the invasion of unwanted airborne particles from entering into the body. Airway geometry, humidity, mucociliary clearance and alveolar macrophages play a vital role in maintaining the sterility of the lung and consequently are barriers to the therapeutic effectiveness of inhaled medications. In addition, a drug\u2019s ef\ufb01cacy may be affected by where in the respiratory tract it is deposited, its delivered dose and the disease it may be trying to treat. Keywords: administration,", "barriers to the therapeutic effectiveness of inhaled medications. In addition, a drug\u2019s ef\ufb01cacy may be affected by where in the respiratory tract it is deposited, its delivered dose and the disease it may be trying to treat. Keywords: administration, aerosol, inhalation, lung, review Introduction Inhaled medications have been available for many years for the treatment of lung diseases and are widely accepted as being the optimal route of administration of \ufb01rst-line therapy for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. In recent years, the lung has been studied as a possible route of administration for the treatment of sys- temic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus. Behind this wave of novel inhaleable drugs is the recent development of new inhalation devices that make it possible to deliver larger drug doses (milligram compared with microgram dosing) to the airways and achieve greater deposition ef\ufb01ciency than the older devices (>50% lung deposition vs. \u00a320% with older devices) [1]. For the lungs to be the target organ or a route of administration, the appropriate amount of drug must be deposited past the oropharyn- geal region to achieve therapeutic effectiveness. The site of deposition, that is on central or peripheral airways, and whether the distribution of the inhaled drug is uni- form or non-uniform may also play a role in an inhaled drug\u2019s effectiveness. Today, there are more than 65 differ- ent inhaled products of more than 20 active ingredients marketed to treat respiratory diseases [2]. Despite the widespread use of inhaled medications, our knowledge is limited with regard to the optimal lung deposition, site for local therapeutic response, the factors that determine the absorption, clearance, and the role the bronchial circulation plays in the redist", "ead use of inhaled medications, our knowledge is limited with regard to the optimal lung deposition, site for local therapeutic response, the factors that determine the absorption, clearance, and the role the bronchial circulation plays in the redistribution of the inhaled agents. In the foreseeable future, not only will we see more ef\ufb01cient and more ef\ufb01cacious inhaled therapies for respi- ratory diseases, but the introduction to market of inhale- ables for gene therapy and the treatment of systemic diseases. With more emphasis on the lung as a route of administration, physicians, pharmacists and other health professionals will need to have a basic understanding of the science behind pulmonary drug delivery. Part I of this review on pulmonary drug delivery addresses the physiological factors affecting therapeutic effectiveness of inhaled drug therapy, including aerosol particle size, air- way geometry, lung clearance mechanisms, and lung dis- ease. In Part II, we consider the role the inhalant delivery devices and drug formulations in therapeutic effectiveness of aerosolized medications. Optimal site of deposition for treatment of lung diseases Inhalation of drugs for the treatment of local diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic \ufb01brosis, and chronic bronchitis, has been commonplace for many years. The advantages of inhaled over systemic delivery of these drugs are listed in Table 1 [3]. The therapeutic effect of aerosolized therapies is dependent upon the dose deposited and its distribution", "tion", "Physiological factors affecting the effectiveness of inhaled drugs \u00a9 2003 Blackwell Publishing Ltd Br J Clin Pharmacol, 56, 588\u2013599 589 within the lung. The in\ufb02uence of the latter on the effectiveness of inhaled therapies is less clear. Ruf\ufb01n and colleagues [4] demonstrated that a small dose of histamine aerosol deposited predominantly in the large conducting (central) airways was as effective in increasing airway obstruction as an 11-fold greater dose of histamine aero- sol deposited diffusely, suggesting that the receptors for histamine reside mainly in the large airways and that surface concentration of a drug affects response. If a drug aerosol is delivered at a suboptimal dose or to a part of the lung devoid of the targeted disease or receptor, the effectiveness of therapy may be compro- mised. The receptors for the b2 agonist, salbutamol and the muscarinic-3 (M3) antagonist, ipratropium bromide are not uniformly distributed throughout the lung. Auto- radiographic studies have shown b2 adrenergic receptors present in high density in the airway epithelium from the large bronchi to the terminal bronchioles. Airway smooth muscle has a lower b-receptor density, greater in the bronchioles than bronchi [5]. However, >90% of all b receptors are located in the alveolar wall, a region where no smooth muscle exists and whose functional signi\ufb01- cance is unknown. Another autoradiographic study has shown a high density of M3 receptors in submucosal glands and airway ganglia and a moderate density in smooth muscles throughout the airways, nerves in intra- pulmonary bronchi and in alveolar walls [6]. The location of these receptors in the lung suggests that ipratropium bromide needs to be delivered to the conducting airways, while salbutamol requires a more peripheral delivery to", "ways, nerves in intra- pulmonary bronchi and in alveolar walls [6]. The location of these receptors in the lung suggests that ipratropium bromide needs to be delivered to the conducting airways, while salbutamol requires a more peripheral delivery to the medium and small airways to produce a therapeutic effect. In contrast to bronchodilators, inhaled anti- in\ufb02ammatory therapy is probably most bene\ufb01cial when evenly distributed throughout the lung, since in\ufb02amma- tory cells, such as eosinophils, lymphocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells, are present throughout the airways and the alveolar tissue in asthma [7, 8]. Since particle size affects the lung deposition of an aerosol, it also can in\ufb02uence the clinical effectiveness of a drug. Johnson and colleagues showed that the bron- chodilation response to cumulative doses of ipratropium bromide delivered either as a 3.3-mm or 7.7-mm aerosol was identical, whereas the response to salbutamol was signi\ufb01cantly greater with the \ufb01ner (3.3 mm) aerosol, sug- gesting targeting drug aerosol to the location of their receptors in the lung does in\ufb02uence its effectiveness (Figure 1) [9]. Rees et al. [10] reported the varying clin- ical effect of 250 mg of aerosolized terbutaline from a metered dose inhaler (MDI) given as three different par- ticle sizes: <5 mm, 5\u201310 mm and 10\u201315 mm. In asthmatics, the greatest increase in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), speci\ufb01c airway conductance (sGaw) and \ufb02ow at 50% of vital capacity (V50) was found with the smallest particle size (<5 mm), suggesting that the smaller particle aerosol was considerably more effective than larger par- ticle size aerosols in producing bronchodilation since it has the best penetration and retention in the lungs in the presence of airway narrowing. Using three monodi", "g that the smaller particle aerosol was considerably more effective than larger par- ticle size aerosols in producing bronchodilation since it has the best penetration and retention in the lungs in the presence of airway narrowing. Using three monodisperse salbutamol aerosols [mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of 1.5 mm, 2.8 mm, 5 mm], Zanen and col- leagues [11] demonstrated in patients with mild to mod- erate asthma that the 2.8 mm particle size aerosol produced a superior bronchodilation compared with the other two aerosols. In patients with severe air\ufb02ow obstruction (FEV1 <40%), Zanen et al. [12] demonstrated that the optimal particle size for b2 agonist or anticho- linergic aerosols is approximately 3 mm. They examined the effect on lung function of equal doses of three dif- ferent sizes of monodisperse aerosols, 1.5 mm, 2.8 mm and 5 mm, of salbutamol and ipratropium bromide. Their \ufb01ndings suggest that small particles penetrate more deeply into the lung and thereby, more effectively dilate the small airways than larger particles, which are \ufb01ltered out in the upper airways. The 1.5-mm aerosol induced Table 1 Advantages of pulmonary delivery of drugs to treat respiratory and systemic disease.

The optimal site of deposition in the respiratory tract for aerosolized antibiotics depends on the infection being treated. Many pneumonias represent a mixture of puru- lent tracheobronchitis and alveolar infection. Successful therapy would theoretically require the antibiotic to be evenly distributed throughout the lungs. However, those con\ufb01ned to the alveolar region would probably bene\ufb01t from a greater peripheral deposition. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, the most common life-threatening infection among patients infected with HIV, is found predomi- nately within the alveolar spaces with relapses occurring in the apical region of the lung after treatment with inhaled pentamidine given as a 1-mm MMAD aerosol [13]. The mechanism suggested for this atypical relapse is the poorer apical deposition of the aerosol. Regional changes in intrapleural pressure result in the lower lung regions receiving relatively more of the inspired volume than the upper lung when sitting in an upright position or standing. This in\ufb02uence on deposition has been shown to occur in an experimental lung model analysing sites of aerosol deposition in a normal lung. The experiment showed a 2 : 1 ratio in overall deposition for a 4 mm aerodynamic diameter aerosol between the lower and upper lobes when in the upright position [14]. Baskin and colleagues [13] demonstrated that this gradient could be reduced by administering aerosolized pentamidine to patients in the supine position. Thus, receiving aero- solize", "between the lower and upper lobes when in the upright position [14]. Baskin and colleagues [13] demonstrated that this gradient could be reduced by administering aerosolized pentamidine to patients in the supine position. Thus, receiving aero- solized pentamidine in the supine position may reduce the risk of relapse in the apical lobes of the lung by increasing the amount of antibiotic deposited in the upper lung regions. This theory remains to be proven in a clinical trial. Chronic lung infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients with cystic \ufb01brosis (CF) or non-CF bronchiecta- sis resides in the airway lumen with limited invasion of the lung parenchyma [15, 16]. Infection starts in the smaller airways, the bronchioles, and moves into the larger airways. The optimal site of deposition for inhaled antimicrobial therapy would therefore be a uniform dis- tribution on the conducting airways. Mucus plugs in the bronchi and bronchioles may prevent deposition of even small particle aerosols in regions distal to the airway obstruction, as shown in Figure 2, possibly the regions of highest infection, and thereby may limit the therapeu- tic effectiveness of the aerosolized antibiotic [17\u201319]. Optimal site of deposition for treatment of systemic diseases Pulmonary drug delivery offers several advantages as a route of administration for the treatment of systemic diseases compared with intravenous, oral, buccal, trans- dermal, vaginal, nasal or ocular administration. The advantages of pulmonary administration are listed in Table 1 [20\u201323]. Until recently, aerosol drug delivery has been limited to topical therapy for the lung and nose.

Most macromolecules cannot be administered orally because proteins are digested before they are absorbed into the bloodstream. Also, their large size prevents them from naturally passing through the skin or nasal mem- brane, and therefore they cannot be administered intra- nasally or transdermally without the use of penetration enhancers. Thus, the easiest route of administration for proteins has been through intravenous or intramuscular/ subcutaneous injection. It has been known for many years that proteins can be absorbed from the lung, as demonstrated with insulin in 1925 [20]. Macromolecules <40 kDa (<5\u20136 nm in diameter) rapidly appear in the blood following inhalation into the airways. Insulin which has a molecular weight (m wt) of 5.7 kDa and a diameter of 2.2 nm peaks in the blood 15\u201360 min after inhalation [24\u201329]. Macromolecules >40 kDa (>5\u20136 nm in diameter) are slowly absorbed over many hours; inhaled albumin (68 kDa) and a1-antitrypsin (45\u201351 kDa) have a Tmax of 20 h and between 12 and 48 h, respec- tively [21]. The lung is the only organ through which the entire cardiac output passes.

Drug absorption is regulated by a thin alveolar\u2013vascular permeable barrier. The num- ber of alveoli ranges from 200 million to 600 million, resulting in an enormous epithelial surface area with epithelium consisting of a thin single cellular layer (0.2\u2013 0.7 mm thickness) [30]. While these properties promote ef\ufb01cient gas exchange through passive transport, they also provide a mechanism for ef\ufb01cient drug delivery to the bloodstream. Although the mechanism of absorption is unknown, it has been hypothesized that macromolecules either pass through the cells via absorptive transcytosis (adsorptive or receptor mediated), paracellular transport between bijunctions or trijunctions, or through large transitory pores in the epithelium caused by cell injury or apoptosis [23, 31]. Thus, the high bioavailability of macromolecules deposited in the lung (10\u2013200 times greater than nasal and gastrointestinal values) may be due to its enormous surface area, very thin diffusion layer, slow surface clearance and antiprotease defence system [23]. Aerosol particle size Aerosol particle size is one of the most important vari- ables in de\ufb01ning the dose deposited and the distribution of drug aerosol in the lung (Figure 3) [32]. Fine aerosols are distributed on peripheral airways but deposit less drug per unit surface area than larger particle aerosols which deposit more drug per unit surface area, but on the larger, more central airways [4]. Most therapeutic aerosols are almost always heterodisperse, cons", " peripheral airways but deposit less drug per unit surface area than larger particle aerosols which deposit more drug per unit surface area, but on the larger, more central airways [4]. Most therapeutic aerosols are almost always heterodisperse, consisting of a wide range of particle sizes and described by the log-normal distribution with the log of the particle diameters plotted against particle number, surface area or volume (mass) on a linear or probability scale and expressed as absolute values or cumulative percentage. Since delivered dose is very important when studying medical aerosols, particle number may be misleading, as smaller particles contain less drug than larger ones, as seen in Figure 4. Particle size is de\ufb01ned from this distribution by several parame- ters. Mass median diameter of an aerosol refers to the particle diameter that has 50% of the aerosol mass resid- ing above and 50% of its mass below it. The aerodynamic diameter relates the particle to the diameter of a sphere of unit density that has the same settling velocity as the particle of interest regardless of its shape or density. MMAD is read from the cumulative distribution curve at the 50% point (Figure 4). Geometric standard devia- tion (GSD) is a measure of the variability of the particle diameters within the aerosol and is calculated from the ratio of the particle diameter at the 84.1% point on the cumulative distribution curve to the MMAD. For a log- normal distribution, the GSD is the same for the num- ber, surface area or mass distributions. A GSD of 1 indicates a monodisperse aerosol, while a GSD of >1.2 indicates a heterodisperse aerosol. Particles can be deposited by inertial impaction, grav- itational sedimentation or diffusion (Brownian motion) depending on their size.

Particles can be deposited by inertial impaction, grav- itational sedimentation or diffusion (Brownian motion) depending on their size. While deposition occurs throughout the airways, inertial impaction usually occurs in the \ufb01rst 10 generations of the lung, where air velocity is high and air\ufb02ow is turbulent [33]. Most particles >10 mm are deposited in the oropharyngeal region with a large amount impacting on the larynx, particularly when the drug is inhaled from devices requiring a high inspiratory \ufb02ow rate (DPIs) or when the drug is dis- pensed from a device at a high forward velocity (MDIs) [34, 35]. The large particles are subsequently swallowed and contribute minimally, if at all, to the therapeutic response. One example is \ufb02uticasone propionate, with its poor oral absorption demonstrated by similar plasma lev- Figure 3 Relationship between particle size and lung deposition.

Hence the oral component of the inhaled dose provides no added therapeutic bene\ufb01t. In contrast are drugs that can be absorbed orally including salbutamol and terbuta- line, that when swallowed can produce a delayed thera- peutic response. In the tracheobronchial region, inertial impaction also plays a signi\ufb01cant role in the deposition of particles, particularly at bends and airway bifurcations. Deposition by gravitational sedimentation predominates in the last \ufb01ve to six generations of airways (smaller bronchi and bronchioles), where air velocity is low [33]. In the alveolar region, air velocity is negligible, and thus the contribution to deposition by inertial impaction is nil. Particles in this region have a longer residence time and are deposited by both sedimentation and diffusion. Particles not deposited during inhalation are exhaled. Deposition due to sedimentation affects particles down to 0.5 mm in diameter, whereas below 0.5 mm, the main mechanism for deposition is by diffusion. Targeting the aerosol to conducting or peripheral air- ways can be accomplished by altering the particle size of the aerosol and/or the inspiratory \ufb02ow rate. It is dif\ufb01cult to predict the actual site of deposition, since airway calibre and anatomy differ among people, but in general, aerosols with a MMAD of 5\u201310 mm are mainly deposited in the large conducting airways and oropharyngeal region [36]. Particles 1\u20135 mm in diameter are deposited in the small airways and alveoli with >50% of the 3 mm diam- eter particles being deposited in the alveolar region. In the case of pulmonary drug delivery for systemic ", "airways and oropharyngeal region [36]. Particles 1\u20135 mm in diameter are deposited in the small airways and alveoli with >50% of the 3 mm diam- eter particles being deposited in the alveolar region. In the case of pulmonary drug delivery for systemic absorp- tion, aerosols with a small particle size would be required to ensure peripheral penetration of the drug [37]. Parti- cles <3 mm have an approximately 80% chance of reach- ing the lower airways with 50\u201360% being deposited in the alveoli [23, 38]. Since this is a new area of scienti\ufb01c research, the most effective particle size for the treatment of systemic diseases has not been determined. The clearance mechanisms of the lung Like all major points of contact with the external envi- ronment, the lung has evolved to prevent the invasion of unwanted airborne particles from entering the body. Airway geometry, humidity and clearance mechanisms contribute to this \ufb01ltration process. The challenge in developing therapeutic aerosols is to produce an aerosol that eludes the lung\u2019s various lines of defence. Airway geometry and humidity Progressive branching and narrowing of the airways encourage impaction of particles. The larger the particle size, the greater the velocity of incoming air, the greater the bend angle of bifurcations and the smaller the airway radius, the greater the probability of deposition by impaction [39]. The lung has a relative humidity of approximately 99.5%. The addition and removal of water can signi\ufb01cantly affect the particle size of a hygroscopic aerosol and thus deposition [40]. Drug particles are known to be hygroscopic and grow or shrink in size in high humidity, such as in the lung, as demonstrated in Figure 5. A hygroscopic aerosol that is delivered at rela- tively low temperature and humidity int", "d thus deposition [40]. Drug particles are known to be hygroscopic and grow or shrink in size in high humidity, such as in the lung, as demonstrated in Figure 5. A hygroscopic aerosol that is delivered at rela- tively low temperature and humidity into one of high humidity and temperature would be expected to increase in size when inhaled into the lung. The rate of growth is a function of the initial diameter of the particle, with Figure 4 Frequency (a) and cumulative (b) distribution curves for Beclovent metered dose inhaler (MDI) used with an Aerochamber, in terms of number of particles and volume (mass) of particles vs. particle aerodynamic diameter. The volume distribution curves are displaced to the right of the number distribution curves. The smaller number of large particles within the aerosol carry the greater mass of the drug; this is re\ufb02ected in the larger, second peak of the volume distribution curve, which corresponds to the smaller second peak of the number distribution curve. Mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) is read from the cumulative distribution curve at the 50% point and if the distribution is log- normal, the geometric standard deviation (GSD) can be calculated as the ratio of the diameter at the 84.1% point to the MMAD. Particle distribution was measured using the Anderson Cascade Impactor. (Reprinted with permission of the author [72].)

The increase in particle size above the initial size should affect the amount of drug deposited and particularly, the distribution of the aerosolized drug within the lung. Ferron and colleagues [42, 43] have predicted that for initial sizes between 0.7 mm and 10 mm, total deposition of hygroscopic aerosols increases by a factor of 2. However, Xu and Yu [44] demonstrated that for NaCl particles with an initial size of 0.1 mm, the distribution pattern in the airways was similar to that for nonhygroscopic particles of the same size with diffusion remaining the primary mechanism of deposition. Using 2D-imaging to detect deposition changes may be unsuc- cessful. A two-to-three-fold increase in diameter would not markedly alter the visible distribution pattern of these submicron gas-like aerosols. The total deposited dose may decrease but the resolution of current imaging techniques is not great enough to distinguish the shifts in generations in this peripheral lung region. For particles with an initial size of 1 mm, Xu and Yu were able to predict changes in the distribution pattern due to particle growth. The cal- culations showed a shift from deposition due to sedimen- tation to primarily impaction on more central airways [43]. Lung clearance mechanisms Once deposited in the lungs, inhaled drugs are either cleared from the lungs, absorbed into the systemic circu- lation or degraded via drug metabolism. Drug particles deposited in the conducting airways are primarily removed through mucociliary clearance and, to a lesser extent, are absorbed thro", "either cleared from the lungs, absorbed into the systemic circu- lation or degraded via drug metabolism. Drug particles deposited in the conducting airways are primarily removed through mucociliary clearance and, to a lesser extent, are absorbed through the airway epithelium into the blood or lymphatic system. Ciliated epithelium extends from the trachea to the terminal bronchioles. The airway epithelial goblet cells and submucosal glands secrete mucus forming a two-layer mucus blanket over the ciliated epithelium: a low-viscosity periciliary or sol layer covered by a high-viscosity gel layer. Insoluble par- ticles are trapped in the gel layer and are moved toward the pharynx (and ultimately to the gastrointestinal tract) by the upward movement of mucus generated by the metachronous beating of cilia. In the normal lung, the rate of mucus movement varies with the airway region and is determined by the number of ciliated cells and their beat frequency. Movement is faster in the trachea than in the small airways and is affected by factors in\ufb02u- encing ciliary functioning and the quantity and quality of mucus [35, 45]. For normal mucociliary clearance to occur, airway epithelial cells must be intact, ciliary struc- ture and activity normal, the depth and chemical com- position of the sol layer optimal and the rheology of the mucus within the physiological range. Mucociliary clear- ance is impaired in lung diseases such as immotile cilia syndrome, bronchiectasis, CF and asthma [46]. In immo- tile cilia syndrome and bronchiectasis, the ciliary function can be either impaired or non-existent. In CF, the ciliary structure and function are normal, but the copious amounts of thick, tenacious mucus present in the airways impairs their ability to clear the mucus effectively [47].

In addition to mucociliary clearance, soluble particles also can be removed by absorptive mechanisms in the conducting airways [51]. Lipophilic molecules pass easily through the airway epithelium via passive transport. Hydrophilic molecules cross via extracellular pathways, such as tight junctions, or by active transport via endocy- tosis and exocytosis [52]. From the submucosal region, particles are absorbed into either the systemic circulation, bronchial circulation or lymphatic system. Drugs deposited in the alveolar region may be phago- cytosed and cleared by alveolar macrophages or absorbed into the pulmonary circulation. Alveolar macrophages are the predominant phagocytic cell for the lung defence against inhaled microorganisms, particles and other toxic agents. There are approximately \ufb01ve to seven alveolar macrophages per alveolus in the lungs of healthy non- smokers [53]. Macrophages phagocytose insoluble parti- cles that are deposited in the alveolar region and are either cleared by the lymphatic system or moved into the ciliated airways along currents in alveolar \ufb02uid and then cleared via the mucociliary escalator [31]. This process can take weeks to months to complete [54]. Soluble drug particles deposited in the alveolar region can be absorbed into the systemic circulation, as discussed above. The pulmonary epithelium appears to be more resistant to soluble particle transport than the endothelium or the interstitium [37]. The rate of protein absorption from the alveoli is size dependent. Effros and Mason [37] demon- st", " as discussed above. The pulmonary epithelium appears to be more resistant to soluble particle transport than the endothelium or the interstitium [37]. The rate of protein absorption from the alveoli is size dependent. Effros and Mason [37] demon- strated an inverse relationship between alveolar perme- ability and molecular weight. In rats, after intratracheal instillation of DDAVP (1-desamino-8-d-arginine vaso- pressin) (m wt 1.1 kDa), peak serum DDAVP levels occurred at 1 h compared with 16\u201324 h after intratra- cheal instillation of albumin (m wt 67 kDa) [38]. How- ever, some proteins are cleared from the lung more rapidly than expected for their size. After intratracheal instillation or aerosolization of human growth hormone (m wt 22 kDa), peak serum levels were observed at 0.5\u20134 h, indicating a rapid, saturable clearance from the lung that is suggestive of receptor-mediated endocytosis [31]. Very little is known about how the drug-metabolizing activities of the lung affect the concentration and therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy of inhaled drugs. All metabolizing enzymes found in the liver are found to a lesser extent in the lung (CYP450 enzymes are 5\u201320 times lower than in liver) distributed throughout the conducting airways and alveoli [55\u201357]. Phase 1 cytochrome-450 (CYP450) enzymes, \ufb02avin-containing monooxygenases (FMO), monoamine oxidase (MAO), aldehyde dehyrogenase, NADPH-CYP450 reductase, for example, are all present in the lung. The monooxygenase system metabolizes fatty acids, steroids and lipophilic xenobiotics. Esterase present in high concentrations in alveolar macrophages, and to a lesser degree in alveolar type I and II cells, hydrolyses beclomethasone dipropionate to its monopropionate and beclomethasone. The human lung, however, appears to be a poor site for sulpha", "ent in high concentrations in alveolar macrophages, and to a lesser degree in alveolar type I and II cells, hydrolyses beclomethasone dipropionate to its monopropionate and beclomethasone. The human lung, however, appears to be a poor site for sulphation. Proteins and peptides are subject to hydrolysis by proteases, such as neutral endopeptidase and cathepsin H, present in the lung. The extent to which various proteins and peptides are metab- olized is unclear. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) is believed to be completely degraded during the passage across the pulmonary epithelium and into the blood- stream [31, 58, 59]. Sources for the proteases are the alveolar macrophages and other in\ufb02ammatory cells, such as neutrophils. Since these enzymes play a key role in the degradation of proteins and peptides, the effect of deliv- ering aerosolized proteins and peptides to in\ufb02amed lungs where the level of proteases is higher, is unknown but may impair their ef\ufb01cacy [30]. Co-administration with protease inhibitors, such as bacitracin and sodium glyco- cholate, have been shown to reduce the metabolism of proteins and thereby improve pulmonary absorption [60, 61]. However, for most proteins degradation in the alve- oli is not a major clearance mechanism, with >95% of proteins, including insulin, being absorbed intact from the lung periphery [31, 59]. Deposition in lung disease Bronchoconstriction, in\ufb02ammation and airway narrowing alter lung deposition. Respiratory diseases, such as CF and bronchiectasis, change the architecture of the lung through alterations in bifurcation angles and obstruction of the airways due to mucus accumulation, modifying the deposition and distribution patterns of aerosols. A decrease in the cross-sectional area of the lung caused by obstruction ", " of the lung through alterations in bifurcation angles and obstruction of the airways due to mucus accumulation, modifying the deposition and distribution patterns of aerosols. A decrease in the cross-sectional area of the lung caused by obstruction increases air velocities and turbulence in regions where the air\ufb02ow is normally laminar. Airway obstruction diverts inspired air to unobstructed airways and, thus, very little drug is deposited in obstructed areas, often the areas that need to be reached in order to achieve the optimal therapeutic effect of the drug. In an obstructed lung, the aerosolized drug will be deposited more centrally in the lungs by inertial impaction com- pared with the uniform distribution achieved in the nor- mal lung, as seen in Figure 6 [62, 63]. Pavia and colleagues [64] demonstrated that the depth of deposition was positively correlated with a patient\u2019s FEV1. Patients with COPD have a signi\ufb01cantly lower aerosol penetra- tion than healthy volunteers (Figure 7) [65\u201367]. How- ever, if their FEV1 is increased through bronchodilation, an increase in peripheral penetration of drug particles can occur (Figure 8). Laube and colleagues studied the effect 13652125, 2003, 6, Downloaded from https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2125.2003.01892.x by Georgia Institute Of Technology, Wiley Online Library on [28/09/2025].

They found that bronchial obstruction enhanced central airway deposition with clearance of the radioaerosol inversely correlated with FEV1. Nearly 50% of the radioaerosol was cleared from the lung after 97 min in those patients with an FEV1 of 30\u201340% compared with <10% when FEV1 was >80%. In patients with low FEV1 (severe obstruction), aerosol distribution was extremely uneven with predom- inately central airway deposition compared with the uni- form distribution characteristic of patients with unobstructed airways. Ilowite et al. [18] also reported an inverse correlation between FEV1 and central airway dep- osition in patients with CF. There was a wide variation in deposited aerosol with a coef\ufb01cient of variation (CV) of 60.2% among patients. When breathing patterns were controlled, the variation in deposition decreased to a CV of 18.6%, highlighting the importance of breathing pat- tern on the deposition of aerosols. Bronchial circulation The lung receives the entire cardiac output and thus is the best perfused organ in the body. However, only the alveolar region and respiratory bronchioles are supplied by the pulmonary circulation. Blood \ufb02ow to the larger airways (trachea to terminal bronchioles) is via the sys- temic circulation and these airways receive approximately 1% of the cardiac output [69].

The endobron- chial circulation is recirculated to the peripheral airways and lung parenchyma via the bronchial veins and right atrium. Bronchial blood \ufb02ow is augmented in diseases, such as bronchiectasis, from 1% to as much as 30% of cardiac output. In sheep, bronchial blood \ufb02ow increased with antigen- and histamine-induced bronchoconstric- tion [70]. Theoretically, inhaled drugs that are absorbed into the circulation from the tracheobronchial regions can be redistributed downstream and peripheral to airway obstructions, into otherwise poorly accessible areas of the lung which may aid in the drug\u2019s ef\ufb01cacy [70, 71]. Thus far, no experimental work in humans has been done to investigate the role of bronchial circulation in lung dis- tribution of inhaled medications or its in\ufb02uence on their ef\ufb01cacy. Conclusions As the end organ for the treatment of local diseases or as the route of administration for systemic therapies, the lung is a very attractive target for drug delivery. It provides direct access the site of disease for the treat- ment of respiratory diseases without the inef\ufb01ciencies and unwanted effects of systemic drug delivery. It pro- vides an enormous surface area and a relatively low enzymatic, controlled environment for systemic absorp- tion of medications. But it is not without barriers.

But it is not without barriers.

A drug\u2019s ef\ufb01cacy may be affected by the site of deposition in the respiratory tract and the delivered dose to that site. To provide an ef\ufb01cient and effective inhalant therapy, these factors must be considered. Aerosol particle size characteristics can play an important role in avoiding the physiologi- cal barriers of the lung, as well as targeting the drug to the appropriate lung region. The type of inhalation devices and drug formulation are determinants of the drug aerosol\u2019s particle size. In Part II, the inhalational delivery devices\u2019 and drug formulations\u2019 effect on the therapeutic effectiveness of aerosolized drug therapy will be reviewed.

Features such as antistatic properties, e\ufb00ective face-to-facemask seal feedback whistles indicating correct in- halation speed, and inhalation indicators all help improve function and performance, and have been demonstrated to improve asthma control, reduce the rate of exacerbations, and improve quality of life. Not all VHCs are the same, and they are not interchangeable. Each pairing of a pMDI device plus VHC should be considered as a unique delivery system. 1. Introduction Inhaled therapy is the gold standard for treatment of asthma [1] and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [2] in patients treated with pressurized metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs). *e \ufb01rst pMDI was introduced in 1956 by Riker Laboratories Inc. and constituted a signi\ufb01cant advancement in the delivery of aerosol medication [3]. pMDIs are now the most widely used devices for the delivery of aerosol medication because of their low cost, e\ufb00ectiveness, and relative simplicity of use [4]. However, despite instruction, many patients are unable to use their pMDIs correctly, with the most common error being the inability to synchronize actuation with inhalation [5]. Spacer devices were introduced in 1958 to improve medication delivery into the lungs and reduce deposition in the mouth and throat [3]. Spacers have undergone a signi\ufb01- cant transformation since their origin as simple home-made tubes such as toilet paper tubes, plastic cups, and empty vinegar bottles [3]. In 1981, both cone and tube spacers were proven to improve medication deposition on the conducting airways without changing alveolar deposition [6]. Around the same time, the valved holding chamber (VHC) was in- troduced. *e VHC built on ", "ottles [3]. In 1981, both cone and tube spacers were proven to improve medication deposition on the conducting airways without changing alveolar deposition [6]. Around the same time, the valved holding chamber (VHC) was in- troduced. *e VHC built on the spacer design by adding a one-way inhalation valve at the exit of the chamber which traps the aerosolized medication within the chamber until the user inhales. VHCs improve pMDI medication delivery, re- duce oropharyngeal deposition of medication, and help users overcome challenges in coordinating pMDI actuation with inhalation [7\u20139]. In 1994, Holzer and Muller [10] showed that valve construction had an impact on the delivery of medi- cation. Subsequent to 1994, VHCs were further improved with respect to facemask design in order to obtain a better face-to-facemask seal, incorporation of antistatic materials to reduce attraction of medication to the chamber walls, and feedback features such as whistles which indicate correct inhalation speed and inhalation indicators (Figure 1). Hindawi Canadian Respiratory Journal Volume 2018, Article ID 5076259, 8 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/5076259", "In 2009, the European Medicines Agency recognized the signi\ufb01cant role of the VHC in drug delivery when they recommended that the development of drug products using a pMDI include testing with at least one named VHC. In addition, they recommended that if a VHC was to be substituted or added, appropriate equivalency data for the alternative VHC must be presented [11]. Current guidelines for asthma [1, 9] and chronic ob- structive pulmonary disease (COPD) [2] mention the use of a spacer in conjunction with pMDIs but do not discuss VHCs in great detail or provide much guidance on their use for health-care providers or caregivers. *e American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI) states that VHCs with whistles and one-way valves are preferable to spacers [12]. 2. pMDIs and the Challenges of Inhaler Technique Inhaled therapies can be very e\ufb00ective treatment for lung diseases. However, they must be used correctly for patients to obtain their full bene\ufb01t. Poor inhaler technique is common with all types of inhalers and has been examined extensively [5, 13, 14]. A review of 2123 asthma patients by the National Services for Health Improvement found that without training, 86% failed to properly use their inhaler [15]. Another study showed that only 1 out of 10 patients using an MDI were able to perform all essential steps correctly [16]. Even with inhaler training, some people will revert back to bad technique, and some will not bene\ufb01t from training [17]. *e most common errors associated with pMDIs are the lack of coordination between actuation and inhalation; halting inhalation when the cool spray hits the back of the throat; not holding the breath long enough (>5 seconds) after inhalation; no exhalation prior to actuation; and not shaking the suspension prior to use [1", "n between actuation and inhalation; halting inhalation when the cool spray hits the back of the throat; not holding the breath long enough (>5 seconds) after inhalation; no exhalation prior to actuation; and not shaking the suspension prior to use [13, 18]. A recent literature review indicates that inhaler technique has not improved over the past 40 years [19]. Implications of poor technique include unintentional noncompliance (patient is compliant but has poor inhaler technique) [14], signi\ufb01cantly reduced e\ufb03cacy of the medi- cations [5, 13, 18], increased risk of hospitalizations and emergency room visits, and poor disease control [13]. Giraud and Roche [18] showed that 71% of adult asthmatic patients are unable to use their inhaler devices e\ufb00ectively, resulting in decreased control of asthma symptoms. All of these lead to increased health-care expenditure [20]. Factors that impact the ability of patients to correctly use inhalers include age, coordination, inhaler technique training, choice of inhaler type, and use of multiple inhalers [2]. Additional challenges arise when patients are prescribed multiple inhaler devices that require di\ufb00erent inhalation techniques. While pMDIs require a slow and deep breath, dry powder inhalers (PDIs), and breath-actuated metered- dose inhalers (BA-MDI) require a fast and deep inhalation [20, 21]. Multiple inhaler users compared to single inhaler users have been shown to experience signi\ufb01cantly more exacerbations, have a higher risk of exacerbations, higher rates of inpatient admissions, inpatient days, urgent care visits, and outpatient visits [22]. Patients using two or more inhaler types that require di\ufb00erent inhaler techniques are prone to a higher frequency of errors and have impaired outcomes. Bosnic\u2013Anticevich et al. [23] showe", "npatient days, urgent care visits, and outpatient visits [22]. Patients using two or more inhaler types that require di\ufb00erent inhaler techniques are prone to a higher frequency of errors and have impaired outcomes. Bosnic\u2013Anticevich et al. [23] showed lower rates of exacerbation and reduced use of high doses of short-acting beta agonists in COPD patients requiring more than one inhaler when the inhalers require similar inhalation techniques compared to inhalers that require di\ufb00erent inhaler techniques. Challenges resulting from poor inhaler technique often start at the point of prescription. *e clinicians responsible for teaching inhaler technique, including nurses, doctors, and respiratory therapists, are often unable to describe or perform the critical steps for using inhalers [24, 25]. One study showed that only 14.2% of >1500 physicians who frequently prescribe medications delivered by inhaled de- vices had adequate knowledge of inhaled therapy, including correct use of inhalers [26]. 3. Valved Holding Chambers (VHCs) A key challenge with pMDIs is the potential for unwanted deposition of drug and excipients in the mouth and the back of the throat. *is remains an issue with hydro\ufb02uoroalkane (HFA) formulations and to some extent with slower, \ufb01ner spray products [27, 28]. Spacer devices and VHCs were initially designed to increase delivery of aerosol medications to the lungs while reducing the oropharyngeal deposition [3]. *e space between the pMDI and the user\u2019s mouth allows for a reduction of aerosol velocity and particle size through both evaporation and particle impaction on the spacer wall. Together, this leads to an increase in the pro- portion of \ufb01ne particles delivered to the lungs, a decrease in large particle deposition in the mouth and throat [29] (Figure 2)", " size through both evaporation and particle impaction on the spacer wall. Together, this leads to an increase in the pro- portion of \ufb01ne particles delivered to the lungs, a decrease in large particle deposition in the mouth and throat [29] (Figure 2) and reduction of associated side e\ufb00ects such as throat irritation, dysphonia, and oral candidiasis that are common with use of pMDIs alone [4, 29]. VHCs act as aerosol reservoirs, allowing the user to actuate the pMDI device and then inhale the medication in a two-step process that reduces the need to coordinate actuation and inhalation at the same time [30]. *is is a particularly important ad- vantage of using VHCs with pMDI devices. *e design of the device can have an impact on its performance. *roughout the development of VHCs, it was recognized that while large-volume holding chambers in- crease lung deposition to a greater degree than tube spacers or small holding chambers, they could be cumbersome for patients. Currently available devices range in volume from 50\u2013750 ml [4]. Larger VHCs may be less portable and ap- pealing, especially among children and teens, which may Inhalation indicator Figure 1: Valved holding chamber featuring an inhalation indicator. 2 Canadian Respiratory Journal 7503, 2018, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2018/5076259 by Georgia Institute Of Technology, Wiley Online Library on [28/09/2025].

Chambers with volumes from 150 to 250 ml have been shown to be as e\ufb00ective as those with volumes of 750 ml [31]. Smaller chamber sizes are generally more e\ufb00ective for infants and small children as they require fewer tidal breaths to empty. One brand introduced in 1983 was the result of a design study to determine the optimal size of chamber, focusing on minimizing the size of the chamber without signi\ufb01cantly reducing \ufb01ne particle output [8]. Roller et al. [32] found that speci\ufb01cally for children (to ages 17 years) using VHCs with pMDI devices, slow in- halation and breath hold (5\u201310 seconds) may be more ef- fective than tidal breaths for lung deposition of extra-\ufb01ne aerosols for users who are capable of this type of breathing. For younger children or individuals with less ability to control their breathing (e.g., delayed or impaired develop- ment), tidal breathing is appropriate. Oropharyngeal and gastrointestinal deposition is reduced using VHCs regardless of inhalation technique. VHCs \ufb01tted with facemasks are useful for infants, young children [1], and elderly patients [4, 31, 33]. *ere are various facemask designs available. *e most important features for optimum aerosol delivery are a tight but comfortable facemask \ufb01t and reduced facemask dead space [30]. Esposito-Festen et al. [34] demonstrated that the ef- \ufb01ciency of a pMDI-spacer facemask strongly depends on the size and location of facemask leaks. Minor leaks can reduce the lung dose by half compared to lung dose received with a facemask with a perfect seal, and leaks near the nose result in more rapidly decreased lung dose compared to leaks near the chin. A \ufb02exible facemask that conforms to the user\u2019s face to prevent leakage is optimal [31]. *e valves of VHCs ideally allow the aerosolized ", "perfect seal, and leaks near the nose result in more rapidly decreased lung dose compared to leaks near the chin. A \ufb02exible facemask that conforms to the user\u2019s face to prevent leakage is optimal [31]. *e valves of VHCs ideally allow the aerosolized med- ication to remain in the chamber until inhalation and the patient to exhale to the atmosphere without blowing the aerosol out of the chamber. Valve design and placement impact the rebreathed volume of the device, which is es- pecially critical for use with infants and young children [20]. Valves are usually the only moving part of a VHC and are made from \ufb02exible components. Users should be taught to inspect the valve integrity when cleaning their VHC devices. Some plastic VHC devices have an inherent electrostatic charge or may build up electrostatic charge within the chamber, which attracts drug particles to the chamber walls and may reduce drug delivery to the lungs [29]. Electrostatic charges may also result in inconsistent delivery of the med- ication [30]. Drug delivery through the use of antistatic chambers can provide clinically relevant improvement in bronchodilator response during acute, reversible broncho- spasm such as nocturnal bronchospasm [35]. Researchers found that forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) increased by 21\u201325% when using an antistatic chamber and concluded that delivery of albuterol through an antistatic chamber provides a clinically relevant improvement in bronchodilator response during acute, reversible broncho- spasm [35]. More recently, Burudpakdee et al. [36] examined a retrospective study database and identi\ufb01ed 9325 patients with asthma in each of two groups: those using a pMDI with the AeroChamber Plus\u00ae Flow-Vu\u00ae Antistatic Valved Holding Chamber (AC-FV AVHC) and those using pMDI ", "Burudpakdee et al. [36] examined a retrospective study database and identi\ufb01ed 9325 patients with asthma in each of two groups: those using a pMDI with the AeroChamber Plus\u00ae Flow-Vu\u00ae Antistatic Valved Holding Chamber (AC-FV AVHC) and those using pMDI with any nonantistatic VHC (control group). *e use of the AC-FV AVHC was associated with lower exacerbation rates, delayed time to \ufb01rst exacerbation, and lower exacerbation-related costs when compared to control nonantistatic VHCs. Further, the proportion of patients visiting the emergency department (ED) was signi\ufb01cantly lower in the AC-FV AVHC group than the control cohort (10.8% versus 12.4%; p < 0.05), and the number of ED visits per patient was also signi\ufb01cantly lower (0.15 visits versus 0.18 visits for the control VHC; p < 0.05). Electrostatic charge within a VHC can also be reduced somewhat by priming the device with multiple actuations of the aerosol medication, but the number of actuations de- pends on the content of the aerosol and can be wasteful of medication. Alternately, washing the chamber with a mild detergent without rinsing and then allowing it to drip dry has proven more e\ufb00ective. *e charge may reaccumulate after about 30 days [20, 31, 37].

Each spacer has its own particular recommended washing and use procedures, and so it is important to follow the instructions in the Patient Information Lea\ufb02et (PIL). Spacers made of antistatic materials or metals such as steel or aluminum are less subject to this problem and therefore, with the incorporation of an e\ufb00ective antistatic material, remove the need for washing with detergent prior to \ufb01rst use [31]. 4. Use of pMDIs with and without VHCs Many studies have assessed disease control and oropha- ryngeal deposition using pMDIs with and without spacers or VHCs. Leach and Colice [28] conducted a small pilot study which showed that both the AeroChamber\u2122and Volumatic\u2122devices used in the study reduced oropharyn- geal deposition of HFA-134a-beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) and CFC-BDP. *ey found that oropharyngeal de- position of HFA-BDP was reduced from approximately 28% to 4% with the AeroChamber. Roller et al. [32] demonstrated a higher lung deposition and marked reduction in oro- pharyngeal deposition of BDP extra-\ufb01ne particles when delivered via an HFA-driven inhaler with an attached VHC compared with delivery via the HFA-driven inhaler alone. Levy et al. [5] found better asthma control in signi\ufb01cantly more patients using BDP through a breath-actuated pMDI device (p < 0.0001) or a spacer (p < 0.0001) compared with those using pMDIs alone. Several studies have assessed the e\ufb03cacy and cost- e\ufb00ectiveness of treating moderate and acute asthma exac- erbations in children and adults in the ED setting. *e use of pMDI plus spacer delivers equal or better clinical outcomes than nebulizers, with signi\ufb01cant savings in costs and health- care provider time c", "s of treating moderate and acute asthma exac- erbations in children and adults in the ED setting. *e use of pMDI plus spacer delivers equal or better clinical outcomes than nebulizers, with signi\ufb01cant savings in costs and health- care provider time compared to nebulizers [39\u201343]. *e majority of studies assessing the e\ufb00ectiveness of using VHCs with pMDIs are conducted under clinical trial settings, with careful training of participants in the devices used, and monitoring to ensure adherence of both medi- cation use and correct use of devices. Guilbert et al. [44] reviewed anonymous medical record data from UK data- bases of patients with asthma prescribed \ufb01ne and extra-\ufb01ne particle ICS with and without spacers. *ey found no dif- ference in rate of severe exacerbations and acute respiratory events. *e authors recognize that the real-life nature of this study data means that the patients were not chosen through highly selective processes that are normally included in clinical trial designs. *ey were unable to determine if pa- tients had been taught to use their devices correctly, whether or not they used them correctly, or in fact if the patients were adherent to treatment (i.e., did they use medications as prescribed, and did they use the spacers). 5. VHCs Are Not Interchangeable VHCs are available in various sizes (Table 1) and, as has been described earlier, incorporate attributes such as valving, chamber shape/material, and facemask size and seal, each can have an impact upon drug delivery. Each pairing of a pMDI device plus VHC should be considered as a unique delivery system. Suggett et al. [45] assessed six VHCs and their associated facemasks for their ability to deliver \ufb01ne particles in an in vitro simulated child model. *ey dem- onstrated signi\ufb01cantly more medicat", "s VHC should be considered as a unique delivery system. Suggett et al. [45] assessed six VHCs and their associated facemasks for their ability to deliver \ufb01ne particles in an in vitro simulated child model. *ey dem- onstrated signi\ufb01cantly more medication delivery from the AeroChamber Plus\u2217Flow-Vu\u2217VHC compared with any of the other antistatic devices evaluated, and regardless of device pretreatment modality. Blake et al. [46] examined the lung bioavailability of \ufb02uticasone propionate pMDI ad- ministered through AeroChamber Plus with facemask and Babyhaler\u00ae VHCs in children from 1 to 4 years of age. Clinically signi\ufb01cant di\ufb00erences in lung bioavailability were observed between the devices. Based on the study results, the authors recommend that parents, clinicians, and pharma- cists should be educated not to interchange VHCs once a child is stable on a particular ICS dose and VHC com- bination and that VHC prescriptions should include a no substitutions statement. A recent study [47] reported an in vitro statistical equivalence study comparing a number of di\ufb00erent, similarly sized VHCs in terms of particle size distribution of the medication delivered. *e study dem- onstrated that only the two AeroChamber Plus VHC vari- ants were equivalent; all the other VHCs tested were both statistically and likely clinically di\ufb00erent (i.e., lower \ufb01ne particle mass). Suggett et al. [48] used an in vitro model to assess the di\ufb00erence between two antistatic and three nonconducting VHCs that look similar, using the AeroChamber Plus\u2217 Flow-Vu\u2217as the reference. Devices were tested before and after following manufacturer-recommended washing pro- cedures. *e in\ufb02uence of wash on the \ufb01ne particle mass delivered from the antistatic devices AeroChamber Plus\u2217 Flow-Vu\u2217and Pocket Chamber was minimal bu", "he reference.

Fine particle mass and total emitted mass (under simulated coordinated and uncoordinated use) were examined and statistically com- pared. All devices showed signi\ufb01cantly di\ufb00erent (reduced) results compared to reference. 6. VHC Approval Process *e European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommends that the development and registration process for new pMDIs includes testing and supporting data (in vitro and in vivo) of the pMDIs when used with speci\ufb01c VHC devices [49]. A separate communication stated that patients whose asthma is well controlled and who are using a spacer should always use the same type of spacer and not switch between spacers [50]. *e EU registration documentation for pMDIs (Summary of Product Characteristics and Patient In- formation Lea\ufb02et) speci\ufb01cally note the VHC to be used should be based upon the device used in the product development/registration studies. For example, in Europe, the following pMDI products recommend the AeroChamber Plus brand of VHCs: Airomir, AirSalb, Alvesco, Atrovent, Flutiform, Fostair, Qvar, Seretide, and Sirdupla. *e EMA is 4 Canadian Respiratory Journal 7503, 2018, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2018/5076259 by Georgia Institute Of Technology, Wiley Online Library on [28/09/2025].

As was stated by Dissanayake and Suggett [47], the FDA\u2019s position is perhaps the most surprising in view of the agency\u2019s zealous approach to dose selection for novel inhaled products and stringent \u201cweight of evidence\u201d approach for generic inhalers which requires the demonstration of in vitro, pharmacokinetic, and clinical equivalence between test and reference devices to support generic product approval. In relation to the equivalence study they performed, the authors go on to state that \u201cin this context, ignoring a two- fold di\ufb00erence in respirable dose between VHCs, as in the present study, is di\ufb03cult to rationalise. Harmonisation of regulatory guidelines across regions would seem desirable.\u201d It is interesting to note that the regulatory review process for devices occurs through a di\ufb00erent body than the pMDI drug products they are to be used with. A medical device should be developed following design controls and applicable regional and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards. Depending upon the device classi\ufb01cation in a given market, approval is requested or self-certi\ufb01cation provided. Although, for example, in Canada, there is a stan- dard for the testing and performance of VHCs [51]; it is not known to what extent all commercially available chambers satisfy the standard as such data are not required in order to gain a registration. *is may lead to substandard VHCs being available for patient use without meeting minimal quality and performance standards. 7. Education Ongoing patient education is a critical fac", "andard as such data are not required in order to gain a registration. *is may lead to substandard VHCs being available for patient use without meeting minimal quality and performance standards. 7. Education Ongoing patient education is a critical factor of correct inhaler technique, adherence, and disease control. A single event of instruction with the prescription of an inhaled medication and/or spacer or VHC is not su\ufb03cient to ensure correct inhaler technique. For example, Kamps et al. [52] demonstrated that three comprehensive instruction sessions increased the number of patients demonstrating correct inhalation technique of pMDI plus spacer from 57.4% to 97.9%. Amin et al. [53] assessed patient and physician con\ufb01dence in the usage of inhalers used to treat COPD. *ey found that approximately 30% of patients had low con\ufb01- dence in their ability to use their inhalers and that low con\ufb01dence was associated with lower adherence and poor COPD-related health status. Education on the correct use of VHCs with pMDIs is important to avoid the potential for new errors introduced with the VHC. *ese may include as incorrect device as- sembly, incorrect inhalation after actuation (e.g., waiting too long to inhale), and actuating more pu\ufb00s than required. [4]. Each VHC device comes with directions for use [31, 38]. Generally, spacers should be positioned before actuating the pMDI, and movement of the spacer should also be avoided, as this will reduce the drug available for inha- lation due to impaction on the sides of the spacer wall. Patient education must be speci\ufb01c to the pMDI and the VHC used [4]. Clinicians can support patients in several ways: (i) Check inhaler technique often.

Clinicians can support patients in several ways: (i) Check inhaler technique often. (ii) Keep devices consistent when changing or adding medications, that is, try not to mix pMDI and DPI devices. Each new pairing of pMDI and VHC re- quires instruction speci\ufb01c to the devices being used. (iii) Use appropriate training aids for encouraging slow inhalation with pMDI devices [14]. (iv) Ensure that VHCs are used with pMDIs by infants and children and by patients with poor coordination or inhaler technique. (v) Ensure that VHCs are used when prescribing corticosteroids with pMDI to reduce oropharyn- geal side e\ufb00ects and absorption via the gut. (vi) Ensure that an appropriate antistatic VHC is pre- scribed to prevent losses of medication to chamber walls. (vii) Instruct patients and caregivers to clean and use VHCs according to the PIL [31, 38]. (viii) Ensure that VHCs with facemasks for infants and young children \ufb01t correctly with a good seal to the face, and that parents/caregivers understand the importance of no leaks [31].

Summary Inhaled aerosol therapy remains the cornerstone of e\ufb00ective treatment of asthma and COPD. While the medications themselves have not changed dramatically over the past decades, the delivery devices have changed. Technology has allowed the development of more e\ufb03cient and user-friendly inhalers. Nevertheless, incorrect inhaler technique remains a signi\ufb01cant barrier to many users of inhaled medications. *e most common errors reported for the use of pMDIs are lack of coordination between actuation and inhalation, halting inhalation when the cool spray hits the back of the throat, not holding the breath long enough (>5 seconds) after inhalation, no exhalation prior to actuation, and not shaking the suspension prior to use. Valved holding chambers confer distinct advantages to the \ufb01rst two chal- lenges. VHCs allow users to approach inhalation of aerosol medication as a two-step process: actuation into to chamber, followed by inhalation from the VHC mouthpiece. Tech- nology has also allowed the development of more e\ufb00ective VHCs. *ere are now antistatic chambers, better valves, more e\ufb00ective facemasks, and other innovations that help deliver the intended dose of medication. VHCs have been proven to improve pMDI medication delivery to the lungs, reduce oropharyngeal deposition, and help users overcome challenges in coordinating pMDI actuation with inhalation [8]. Moreover, newer VHCs with multiple advances (anti- static chamber and inhalation indicators) have been re- ported to improve asthma control, reduce the rate of exacerbations, and improve quality of life [36, 54]. VHCs are not all the same, and also are not interchangeable.

VHCs are not all the same, and also are not interchangeable. Ongoing education is critical to ensure that users are consistently able to use their inhalers.

It is also becoming the preferred route for insulin delivery, pain management, cancer therapy, and nanotherapeutics. Popular delivery devices include neb- ulizers, metered-dose inhalers, and dry-powder inhalers. They are all nondi- rectional and hence have typically low particle deposition ef\ufb01ciencies in de- sired nasal or lung areas. Thus, for speci\ufb01c disease treatment with costly and/or aggressive medicine, it is necessary to provide targeted drug\u2013aerosol delivery to predetermined sites in the human respira", "ly low particle deposition ef\ufb01ciencies in de- sired nasal or lung areas. Thus, for speci\ufb01c disease treatment with costly and/or aggressive medicine, it is necessary to provide targeted drug\u2013aerosol delivery to predetermined sites in the human respiratory system. Experimen- tal measurements and computer models of particle transport and deposition in nasal and lung airway models are presented. Furthermore, the underlying methodology and performance of pressurized metered dose inhalers as well as new smart inhaler systems are discussed. To maximize respiratory drug delivery to speci\ufb01c sites, an optimal combination of particle characteristics, inhalation waveform, particle release position, and drug-aerosol dosage has to be achieved. 195 Click here for quick links to Annual Reviews content online, including: \u2022 Other articles in this volume \u2022 Top cited articles \u2022 Top downloaded articles \u2022 Our comprehensive search Further ANNUAL REVIEWS", "Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org.

Furthermore, the nose and mouth are now also used as portals to deliver medicine for pain management and systemic therapy, respectively. The novel oral pathway leads potentially to rapid, nondestructive, and noninvasive drug transfer into the systemic blood stream because of the large lung surface area involved (i.e., more than 16 million airways), excellent blood perfusion, large capacity for solute exchange, and a thin epithelium when reaching the alveolar region (1). However, to be successful and cost-effective, drug-aerosol delivery has to be targeted. Maximum deposition of suitable therapeutic solid particles (or droplets or vapor) at predetermined sites, which are related to speci\ufb01c diseases, minimizes potential side effects in the case of aggressive drugs and reduces health care cost with the increased ef\ufb01cacy. An example for the need of optimal drug-aerosol targeting is asthma, although conventional inhalation therapy is widely considered to be suf\ufb01cient. Asthma therapy relies on antiin\ufb02ammatory corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonists, typically delivered in powder or droplet-spray form with off-the-shelf inhalers. Nevertheless, Tashkin (2) showed tha", "herapy is widely considered to be suf\ufb01cient. Asthma therapy relies on antiin\ufb02ammatory corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonists, typically delivered in powder or droplet-spray form with off-the-shelf inhalers. Nevertheless, Tashkin (2) showed that 20%\u201350% of patients fail to achieve good control of their symptoms, while 50%\u201385% are unable to gain total control, i.e., 24-h normal lung function. The main reasons for these depressing statistics are the limitations of current inhalation therapy, including shortcomings in drug effectiveness and inhaler ef\ufb01ciency. These shortcomings imply the inability of the drug to reach the peripheral airways, which, together with the large central airways, are a major site of pathology in asthma. Dose-delivery ef\ufb01ciencies of current asthma-drug inhaler devices range from 10% to 30% for adult users and 3% to 15% for children (3, 4). With often multiple daily inhaler use by millions of asthma sufferers, device ef\ufb01ciencies are in dire need of improvement for more effective treatment and cost saving. Several aspects of drug-aerosol delivery have been recently reviewed in the books edited by Gradon & Marijnissen (5), as well as Hickey (6). Selected book chapters address drug parti- cle characteristics (see contributions by Heyder et al., Vanbever, Hickey, Hiller), inhaler type (e.g., contributions by Pritchard, Hickey, Clark), experimental/computational aerosol-deposition 196 Kleinstreuer\u00b7 Zhang\u00b7 Donohue", "Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org. Georgia Institute of Technology (ar-223325) IP: 128.61.160.124 On: Sun, 28 Sept 2025 07:46:19 modeling (see contributions by Cheng, Finlay), and drug-aerosol targeting (e.g., contributions by Zanen, Gonda). The book by Finlay (7) and the volume edited by Bissgard et al. (8) also discuss pertinent elements of drug delivery to the lungs. Targeting is here understood as a physical goal to bring drug-aerosols from their release points (i.e., the inhaler exit) to a desired landing area in the respiratory system for maximum medical effectiveness, needed either locally or systemically. To achieve that goal, future inhaler devices have to operate based on a targeting methodology featuring optimal (a) particle characteristics, (b) inhalation waveform, (c) particle-release positions, and (d ) concentration range of deposited particles. This mechanistic approach differs from drug targeting via special design of molecular, carrier, and controlled-release properties, including magnetic drug targeting, which cause selective distribution characteristics and pharmacokinetic behavior leading to improved therapy (9\u201312). The following sections provide background information needed to appreciate targeted drug- aerosol delivery via mechanical transport, followed by a discussion of its underlying principles. Speci\ufb01cally, the review begins with a description of human airway morphologies, simulation results for particle deposition in key segments of the respiratory tract, and performance variations of standard inhaler devices to then focus on methodologies for optimal drug-aerosol targeting. AIRWAY MODELS Accurate and realistic airway models are the necessary precursor for experimental or compu- tational air\ufb02ow and particle transport/deposition analyses. ", " inhaler devices to then focus on methodologies for optimal drug-aerosol targeting. AIRWAY MODELS Accurate and realistic airway models are the necessary precursor for experimental or compu- tational air\ufb02ow and particle transport/deposition analyses. Once a comprehensive, \ufb02exible, and experimentally validated computer simulation model has been developed, operational parameters for optimal drug-aerosol targeting can be determined and a smart inhaler system can be designed for device prototyping and patient-speci\ufb01c therapy applications. In any case, the nasal plus oral airways are labeled the extrathoracic region, which forms with the tracheobronchial and alveolar regions of the respiratory system (Figure 1). From a functional viewpoint, the respiratory tract is divided into the conducting zone (i.e., generations 0 to 16) and the respiratory zone (generations 17 to 23), where the O2-CO2 gas exchange takes place (13). An alternative geometric division would include the extrathoratic, upper bronchial, lower bronchial, and alveolar region. There are two modern approaches for generating geometric lung models for computa- tional/experimental analyses, i.e., either via algorithms that specify inhaled-volume-based rules for the relationships between parent and daughter airways [e.g., Kitaoka et al. (14) and Tawhai et al. (15)] or lung replicas digitally reconstructed from CT-scans or MRI data [e.g., Van Ertbruggen et al. (16)]. Using the \ufb01rst approach, Tebeckhorst et al.

The \ufb01rst step is to generate patient-speci\ufb01c airway (or blood-vessel) geometry data \ufb01les. The generic procedure is as follows: \u25a0 CT-scan images of a subject\u2019s body part (i.e., DiCom \ufb01les), enhanced with a contrasting agent, are obtained from a radiologist or surgeon. It should be noted that the determination of airway or vessel-wall thickness is still rather dif\ufb01cult. MRI, measuring the amount of hydrogen, is good for distinguishing different tissues; thus, it may help to estimate variable www.annualreviews.org \u2022 Targeted Drug-Aerosol Delivery 197", "Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org.

The time between contrast agent intake and CT-scanning is crucial because the chemical should only change the apparent blood density before migrating into the tissue and by then greatly diminishing the contrast between blood and tissue. \u25a0 The DiCom \ufb01les are loaded into geometric\u2013\ufb01le\u2013conversion software, such as Mim- ics/Geomagic (Materialise, Belgium) or Simpleware (Simpleware Ltd, Exeter, United King- dom). It enables the modeler to edit the images, isolate the structures of interest, and generate 3-D geometry models. \u25a0 The CAD-like geometry \ufb01les are then exported in suitable formats, typically to computa- tional \ufb02uid dynamics (CFD) software, for numerical \ufb02uid \ufb02ow and solid structure analysis [see, for example, Wolters et al. (20), Li & Kleinstreuer (21), and Shi et al. (22), among many others]. Alternatively, the three-dimensional (3D) \ufb01nite element computer model can be exported as an STL-\ufb01le (stereolithography) to a rapid prototyping machine to build a physical model for laboratory studies [e.g., Kratzberg et al.

Historically, lung aerosol dynamics investigations were mainly concerned with toxic particulate matter deposition and subsequently with the implications of dosimetry and health effects. Maturing CFD techniques allowed for noninvasive, high-resolution, cost-effective, and safe simulations of air\ufb02ow pattern, particle transport, particle deposition, and particle mass transfer into the lung tissue. Major sim- pli\ufb01cations made include somewhat idealized rigid airways with smooth (sticky) surfaces, spherical noninteracting \ufb01ne or ultra\ufb01ne particles, and constant inhalation \ufb02ow rates. The geometry of the respiratory system is very complex, augmented by changing wall bound- aries, rough surfaces, moving mucus layers, etc., as alluded to in the previous section. The condition of deposition is usually ful\ufb01lled when a particle is one radius away from the wall, i.e., it touches an airway surface. The assumption of dilute micron-particle suspensions allows for separate com- putations of the air\ufb02ow (Eulerian approach solving the Navier-Stokes equations) and the particle dynamics (Lagrangian approach solving Newton\u2019s second law of motion). The same holds for the analysis of submicron particles; however, in that case, an Euler-Euler approach is recommended, i.e., the nanoparticle (or vapor) phase is described with the mass transfer equation containing an appropriate diffusion term (26\u201328). For dense suspension \ufb02ows, e.g., nasal droplet sprays, bot", "r, in that case, an Euler-Euler approach is recommended, i.e., the nanoparticle (or vapor) phase is described with the mass transfer equation containing an appropriate diffusion term (26\u201328). For dense suspension \ufb02ows, e.g., nasal droplet sprays, both phases are coupled, and hence \ufb02uid-particle interactions have to be modeled, typically via a mo- mentum source term (27, 29). Most naturally occurring and man-made particles, including most drug aerosols, are nonspherical and hence require special mathematical description for accurate trajectory and deposition simulations. Droplets, as well as thermal and humidity effects in the res- piratory environment, require also special considerations, as discussed below. The assumption of quasi-steady inhalation is justi\ufb01able for micron-particle-deposition modeling, when an equivalent inlet Reynolds number is selected. Speci\ufb01cally, Zhang et al. (30) showed that such an equivalent dimensionless group is the arithmetic mean of the maximum and mean Reynolds numbers of the given inhalation waveform. For elevated inhalation \ufb02ow rates, i.e., Qin > 12 liters min\u22121 during exercise, transition to turbulent air\ufb02ow after the larynx (see Figure 1) may occur with relami- narization further downstream. The low-Reynolds number k-\u03c9 turbulence model of Wilcox (31) adequately describes these changing \ufb02ow regimes (32\u201335). The rapidly growing interest in using the mouth/nose as portals for the delivery of medicine caused a shift in the application and interpretation of computational/experimental inhalation stud- ies, i.e., toxic particle deposition results appeared as therapeutic drug-aerosol targeting outcome. One early example is the determination of a critical tumor radius for which drug-aerosol deposi- tion was at a maximum for all inlet Reynolds a", "stud- ies, i.e., toxic particle deposition results appeared as therapeutic drug-aerosol targeting outcome. One early example is the determination of a critical tumor radius for which drug-aerosol deposi- tion was at a maximum for all inlet Reynolds and Stokes number combinations (36). Work for this paper spawned the idea of optimal drug-aerosol targeting, which is discussed in the last section. Micron-Particle Deposition Micron-particle deposition in the lung may occur via impaction, including secondary air\ufb02ow convecting particles to the airway walls, diffusion, and/or sedimentation, i.e., gravitational effect. Inertial impaction is proportional to the air \ufb02ow rate (Q) and the (aerodynamic) particle diameter (dp) squared, as expressed with the impaction parameter (IP), i.e., IP = Qd 2 p or I \u02c6P = \u03c1p Qd 2 p , (1a,b) where \u03c1p is the particle density. Diffusional and gravitational mechanisms are measurable at very low \ufb02ow rates, i.e., typically in the lower lung regions, with diffusion dominant for ultra\ufb01ne www.annualreviews.org \u2022 Targeted Drug-Aerosol Delivery 199", "Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org. Georgia Institute of Technology (ar-223325) IP: 128.61.160.124 On: Sun, 28 Sept 2025 07:46:19 particles in areas of high concentration gradients and gravity effects signi\ufb01cant for relatively large/heavy particles (37). Key in diffusional transport of spherical nanomaterial due to the Brow- nian motion effect is the diffusion coef\ufb01cient after Stokes-Einstein: Dnano = (kBTCslip)/(3\u03c0\u03bcd p), (2) where kB is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 \u00d7 10\u221223 J K\u22121) and Cslip is the Cunningham slip correc- tion factor (38). In general, for particle-deposition studies, the Stokes number is used: St = \u03c4p : \u03c4 f = \u03c1pd 2 pU 18\u03bcD , (3) which is the ratio of particle relaxation and \ufb02ow characteristic times. Thus, St = fct. (characteristic air velocity U and length scale D) is a measure of the in\ufb02uence of the inertial effects during a particle\u2019s trajectory. However, in the (human) respiratory system, the local airway geometries are rather complex or exhibit sudden changes, while the air\ufb02ow velocities are rapidly changing as well. Thus, Stokes numbers as well as Reynolds numbers have to be de\ufb01ned locally to capture more accurately the underlying physics of micron-particle deposition. Assuming noninteracting spherical micron particles, a Lagrangian frame of reference can be employed, and in light of the large particle-to-air density ratio, dilute particle suspensions, and negligible particle rotation, drag is the dominant force, with additional forces relevant near the airway walls. Thus, Newton\u2019s second law of motion can be written for laminar and turbulent micron-particle transport as d dt (mpu p i ) = FD + F gravity i + ni(t) + F lubrication i + F P\u2212Winteract. i , (4) where uP i and mp are the velocity and mass of the particle, respectively, and ni(t) is an i", "n can be written for laminar and turbulent micron-particle transport as d dt (mpu p i ) = FD + F gravity i + ni(t) + F lubrication i + F P\u2212Winteract. i , (4) where uP i and mp are the velocity and mass of the particle, respectively, and ni(t) is an interaction force due to Brownian motion that results from collision of air molecules with the particles of dp < 1 \u03bcm (39). The Brownian force can be modeled as a Gaussian white noise random process (40\u201342). In Equation 4, FD is the drag force. Independent of particle shape, the drag force can be formulated as FD = 1 2CD\u03c1 Ap \u0002 ui \u2212u p i \u0003 \u0004\u0004u j \u2212u p j \u0004\u0004 . (5) Here, \u03c1 is the air density, Ap is the projected particle area, and CD is the particle drag coef\ufb01cient. The underlined forces in Equation 4 can be activated in the near-wall region. Speci\ufb01cally, the lubrication (or wall drag) force, as well as the Saffman-type lift force, have been evaluated and validated for a particle-hemodynamics system by Longest et al. (43). For high aerosol loadings, a particle-particle interaction (or collision) force will be added. In Equation 5, ui is the instantaneous \ufb02uid velocity, with ui = \u00afui + u\u2032 i, where \u00afui is the time- averaged or bulk velocity of the \ufb02uid and u\u2032 i are its \ufb02uctuating components. Traditionally, turbu- lence is assumed to consist of a collection of randomly directed eddies; hence, an eddy-interaction model (EIM) is used to simulate the particle trajectories, and the \ufb02uctuating velocities, u\u2032 i, are obtained with near-wall correction function (44, 45).

Recently, micron-particle transport and deposition in the human nasal airways have gained attention due to the advancements in new nasal drug delivery technologies and computer simulations (64\u201368). However, very little information is available regarding transport and deposition of vaporizing droplets in the human nasal airways (68). Nanoparticle Transport There are relatively few investigations of spherical nanoparticle deposition in human airways, primarily because of the dif\ufb01culty of nanoparticle generation for experimental measurements and accurate predictions with computational \ufb02uid-particle dynamics (CFPD) simulations. The appropriate modeling approach for ultra\ufb01ne particle transport is the mass-transfer equation, with the Stokes-Einstein equation for the Brownian motion\u2013type nanoparticle diffusivity (Dnano) (see Equation 2): \u2202Y \u2202t + \u2202 \u2202x j (u jY) = \u2202 \u2202x j \u0005\u0006 Dnano + \u03bdT \u03c3Y \u0007 \u2202Y \u2202x j \b , (6) where Y is the mass fraction and \u03c3Y is the turbulent Schmidt number. The regional deposition fraction can be determined according to Fick\u2019s law (69), i.e., DFregion = n i=1 \u0005 \u2212Ai \u0006 \u02dcD + \u03bdT \u03c3Y \u0007 \u2202Y \u2202n \u0004\u0004\u0004\u0004 i \b (QinYin), (7) where Ai is the area of the local wall cell (i) and n is the number of wall cells in one certain airway region, e.g., oral airway, \ufb01rst airway bifurcation, etc. The local deposition patterns of nanoparticles can again be", " \u2202Y \u2202n \u0004\u0004\u0004\u0004 i \b (QinYin), (7) where Ai is the area of the local wall cell (i) and n is the number of wall cells in one certain airway region, e.g., oral airway, \ufb01rst airway bifurcation, etc. The local deposition patterns of nanoparticles can again be quanti\ufb01ed in terms of a deposition enhancement factor (DEF) (28, 48, 49), which is de\ufb01ned as the ratio of local to average deposition densities, i.e., DEF = \u0005\u0006 \u02dcD + \u03bdT \u03c3Y \u0007 \u2202Y \u2202n \u0004\u0004\u0004\u0004 i \b n i=1 \u0005 Ai \u0006 \u02dcD + \u03bdT \u03c3Y \u0007 \u2202Y \u2202n \u0004\u0004\u0004\u0004 i \b n i=1 Ai . (8) Assuming that the airway wall is a prefect sink for aerosols upon touch, the boundary condition at the wall is Yw = 0. This assumption is reasonable for fast aerosol-wall reaction kinetics (70) and also suitable for estimating conservatively the maximum deposition of particles or toxic vapors in airways. In a series of papers, Cheng et al. (71\u201375) published their measurements of mass transfer and deposition of ultra\ufb01ne particles (3.6 nm < dp < 150 nm) in a human nasal and oral airway cast, Cohen et al. (76) reported their experimental work on nanoparticle deposition in an upper tracheo- bronchial airway cast, Kelly et al. (77) measured the nasal deposition ef\ufb01ciencies of nanoparticles with diameter between 5 and 150 nm, and Daigle et al. (78) and Kim & Jaques (79) measured total respiratory tract deposition fraction of nanoparticles (8\u2013100 nm) in healthy adults. Examples of numerical simulations for nanoparticle deposition include Asghraiam & Anjilvel (39), Bal\u00b4ash\u00b4azy et al. (80, 81), Hofmann et al. (82), Kelly et al.

Considering main segments of the entire respi- ratory system and assuming slow inhalation with a 5-s breath hold (88), Figure 2b indicates that relatively large particles get stuck in the mouth/throat due to impaction, whereas 0.8\u20136 micron particles may accumulate in the alveolar region because the majority of submicron particles can be exhaled.

Thus, \ufb02uid-structure interaction aspects may become important when patients use inhaler devices, although it is estimated that changes in airway dimension have no direct effect on airway \ufb02uid mechanics during normal breathing (89), with the exception of the moving (contracting/expanding) airway walls in the lower airways and alveolar sacs. For example, Haber et al. (90) simulated the trajectories and deposition of \ufb01ne particles (0.5\u20132.5 \u03bcm in diameter) in a 3D symmetrically expanding and contracting hemispherical alveolus, and they concluded that gravitational deposition processes and deposition sites in rhythmically expanding and contracting alveoli differed from conventional predictions that treat the acinar duct as a straight pipe with rigid walls. However, the motion of alveolar walls was set arti\ufb01cially in this study, and hence realistic \ufb02uid-structure interaction was not considered. Li & Kleinstreuer (91) performed lattice- Boltzmann modeling of air\ufb02ow and microparticle transport/deposition in an alveolated bifurcating duct and demonstrated that distensible-wall and gravity effects on microparticle deposition are important. To date, little information is available about modeling of vapor or ultra\ufb01ne particle (<100 nm) deposition in the alveolar region. In fact, the large uptake of less-soluble vapors may occur in the pulmonary region. In addition, the low surface tension produced by a surfactant \ufb01lm in the deeper parts of the lung, including the alveolar region, may aid the transfer of ultra\ufb01ne particles through t", "ge uptake of less-soluble vapors may occur in the pulmonary region. In addition, the low surface tension produced by a surfactant \ufb01lm in the deeper parts of the lung, including the alveolar region, may aid the transfer of ultra\ufb01ne particles through the liquid wall layer (92) so that the therapeutic (or toxicity) effect of deposited particles in these regions is enhanced. INHALER DEVICES As mentioned in the Introduction, above, several book chapters in Bissgard (8), Finlay (7), Gradon & Marijnissen (5), and Hickey (6) discuss the pros and cons of inhaler devices, i.e., mainly pres- surized metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs) and dry-powder inhalers (DPIs), as well as conceptual nebulizer systems (NSs) for the treatment of asthma and COPD symptoms. The prescription for pMDIs [with hydro\ufb02uoroalkane (HFA) as the propellant] remain dominant, at least in the United States and the United Kingdom, because they are easier to use (at least for some patients), more reliable, and cheaper per dose. However, the advent of multidose blister packs, i.e., new formula- tions and manufacturing technologies, has vastly improved DPI performance and ease of use (93). Prior to the 30-year-old pMDIs, heavy, bulky, and power-intensive nebulizers were employed in acute ambulatory care or at hospitals and at home. Either via air-jet or ultrasonic vibration, a \ufb01ne droplet spray or mist can be produced, which may deposit in the deeper lung regions. Presently, new portable NSs are under development. Parallel to improved inhaler designs, laboratory models are being re\ufb01ned to estimate pulmonary absorption rates of inhaled medicine and provide local aerosol deposition data for computer-model validations (1). Drug-aerosol deposition depends on several factors, of which the inhalation \ufb02ow rate, Qin (t), i.e., ", "eing re\ufb01ned to estimate pulmonary absorption rates of inhaled medicine and provide local aerosol deposition data for computer-model validations (1). Drug-aerosol deposition depends on several factors, of which the inhalation \ufb02ow rate, Qin (t), i.e., the patient\u2019s breathing pattern, particle size, and airway geometry are the most important. However, particle shape, density, thermodynamic state, and surface characteristics, including roughness and charge, may be in\ufb02uential as well. In any case, for inhaler-device design, only breathing pattern and particle characteristics can be traditionally manipulated (37, 94). Pressurized Metered-Dose Inhalers A pMDI is a compact, easy-to-use droplet spray dispenser for multiple-dose treatment of pul- monary diseases, the most common being asthma. Typically 200 high-pressure (Pcanister > 10 atm) actuations, containing 20\u20135000 \u03bcg of drug in metered volumes of 25\u2013100 \u03bcL, can be generated 204 Kleinstreuer\u00b7 Zhang\u00b7 Donohue", "Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org. Georgia Institute of Technology (ar-223325) IP: 128.61.160.124 On: Sun, 28 Sept 2025 07:46:19 and inhaled [see, for example, Dunbar (95) and Dunbar et al. (96)]. A key component of the de- vice is the actuator spray nozzle (with ori\ufb01ce diameters of 0.25 to 0.5 mm), which controls the atomization process and resultant spray formation in terms of spray angle and droplet size dis- tribution. The formulation in pMDIs consists of a therapeutic material and a propellant as well as surfactants and other excipients that dissuade drug-aerosol coagulation and lubricate moving parts of the metering valve. Although pressurized chloro\ufb02uorocarbon (CFC) substances are being phased out worldwide because released chlorine atoms deplete Earth\u2019s ozone layer, HFA (e.g., HFA-134a and HFA-227) have become replacement propellants. However, due to the different physical and chemical properties of CFC and HFA, both the formulation in pMDIs and their structural elements had to be modi\ufb01ed (97). In any case, 70%\u201380% of the discharged formulation is liquid, with nozzle exit velocities in the range of 150\u2013225 m s\u22121. The overall goal for pMDIs is to deliver most of the medicine to a patient\u2019s bronchopulmonary tree and lower airways, i.e., avoiding depositions inside the actuator and in the oral airways. Numerous in vitro and in vivo tests with pMDIs have been conducted to approach that goal, where companies usually employ a geometric model of the upper airways, i.e., the United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) throat and the Andersen cascade impactor, to estimate particle size from pMDIs and to estimate deposition pattern using gamma scintigraphy. For example, Leach et al. (98) compared CFC- and HFA-driven pMDI performances. Whereas most of the drug aerosols from CFC-", "he Andersen cascade impactor, to estimate particle size from pMDIs and to estimate deposition pattern using gamma scintigraphy. For example, Leach et al. (98) compared CFC- and HFA-driven pMDI performances. Whereas most of the drug aerosols from CFC-pMDIs remained in the oropharyngeal region (i.e., 80%\u201390%), HFA-pMDIs delivered up to 60% of the inhaled medicine into the central and intermediate lung zones. Such an increase in drug delivery with newer HFA-pMDIs can be contributed to the improved formulation characteristics and actuator design as well as the use of spacers (99, 100), resulting in smaller drug aerosols. In vitro tests were carried out by a number of researchers (101\u2013103), who argued that the use of a realistic human upper airway replica is preferable to the USP throat, and they compared CFC- versus HFA-pMDI performances, considering the holding chamber and consistent drug dosing, the effect of temperature, the in\ufb02uence of spacers, and the impact of ori\ufb01ce diameter on spray force. Figures 4a,b illustrate the impact of a simple spacer in terms of enhanced droplet percentage reaching the tracheobronchial tree (104). In summary, if properly used (105), HFA-pMDIs may deliver a signi\ufb01cant portion of the inhaled medicine to the central lung region; however, therapeutic droplet deposition is nondirectional and most treatments require high-percentage drug aerosol deposition at speci\ufb01c lung sites, such as the peripheral airways, tumors, or deeper lung regions, e.g., alveolated ducts. Dry-Powder Inhalers Various DPIs are available and all breath-actuated, i.e., propellant-free, thereby eliminating the coordination problem sometimes encountered with pMDIs. Coates et al.

Coates et al. (106) analyzed computa- tionally and experimentally the in\ufb02uence of air\ufb02ow rate of a DPI on particle dispersion and throat deposition. An optimal inhaler performance was found at Q = 65 liters min\u22121. The dry-powder formulation is a critical component of a DPI (see 107, 108, among others). Most formulations are sensitive to moisture during manufacturing, storage, and usage, which may affect the ultimate delivery of 1 to 5 micron-sized, stable, and reproducible drug aerosols. However, new packaging technologies, including multidose blister packs, the use of nonirritating excipients, and improved device designs have made DPIs more acceptable (109). Table 1 summarizes the advantages, disadvantages, and appropriate usage of the three types of inhaler devices presently on the market.

Major areas for improvements include high, controlled ef\ufb01cacy of drug delivery; sustained drug release and rapid absorption; ease of use of the device; and operational independence from healthcare workers. Although pulmonary delivery is very attractive because of the large absorption area and avoidance of \ufb01rst-pass metabolism in the liver, goals such as device effectiveness, ease of use, and low cost, as well as dosage reproducibility, sustained drug release, rapidtissueuptake,optimaltargeting,andreducedsideeffects,are still ratherelusive.Nevertheless, www.annualreviews.org \u2022 Targeted Drug-Aerosol Delivery 207", "Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org. Georgia Institute of Technology (ar-223325) IP: 128.61.160.124 On: Sun, 28 Sept 2025 07:46:19 in light of the fast growing and very pro\ufb01table drug-delivery market, the pharmaceutical industry and medical device companies seek technical solutions to these problems to meet the demands of investors, stock holders, healthcare providers, and patients. It is evident that nebulizer systems, including nasal spray devices, metered-dose inhalers, and dry-powder inhalers, are nondirectional, i.e., they cannot target drug aerosols to predetermined sites in a controlled repeatable fashion. Furthermore, ideal-size monodisperse aerosols and the best inhalation \ufb02ow waveform synchronized with particle transport cannot be generated. To some- what improve the situation, research and development (R&D) efforts in academia and industry focused mainly on trained breathing, e.g., bolus inhalation (37), as well as combined propellant formulation and device improvements for pMDIs and DPIs. New NS concepts have been pursued as well. Concerning the pulmonary pathway, the goals are to produce drug-aerosol and delivery characteristics that lead to deeper and/or peripheral lung penetration at higher deposition con- centrations, mainly for asthma and COPD patients (94, 108, 110, 112\u2013119). As a result, inhaler products on the market, in terms of new formulations used in modi\ufb01ed pMDI and DPI devices, exhibit remarkable performance improvements. Speci\ufb01cally, Clark (113) showed that prior to 1995 the average lung delivery ef\ufb01ciencies for both pMDIs and DPIs was approximately 20%, whereas by the year 2000 reported values were 40%\u201360% and conceptual soft mist inhalers reaching up to 80%. Again, these high ef\ufb01ciencies only indicate that most of the inhaled drug aerosols", " ef\ufb01ciencies for both pMDIs and DPIs was approximately 20%, whereas by the year 2000 reported values were 40%\u201360% and conceptual soft mist inhalers reaching up to 80%. Again, these high ef\ufb01ciencies only indicate that most of the inhaled drug aerosols did not get stuck in the throat, i.e., their pulmonary depositions are nonfocused. In addition to improvements in formulation, packaging, and device components, researchers also considered the manipulation of the patient\u2019s mode of inhalation. For example, Denyer et al. (120) describe an adaptive aerosol nebulizer where only during the \ufb01rst part of the inhalation cycle is a \ufb01nite drug amount pulsed into the air stream. This patient-speci\ufb01c timing of the aerosol pulse minimizes waste of medicine, which is of major concern for NSs. In contrast, Bondesson et al. (121) suggested time-point delivery of dry powder late in the inhalation cycle to achieve stronger lung penetration. Heyder (37) argued that effective targeting of the bronchial region can only be achieved with bolus inhalation. Bennett et al. (122) reviewed inhalation techniques and best particle sizes for targeting serial and especially parallel lung regions. They concluded that shallow aerosol boluses, or very slow inhalation, may selectively target the conducting airways, whereas large-volume inhalation with breath-hold allow for easy aerosol delivery to the alveolar region. Another example of manipulating breathing pattern is the enforcement of biphasic inhalation for DPIs (123), where \ufb01rst a small volume (e.g., a 6.5-\u03bcm droplet bolus of 300\u2013900 mL) is slowly inhaled at 8 liters min\u22121, followed 10 s later by a rapid inspiratory \ufb02ow rate of 30 liters min\u22121. This procedure imposed on 10 healthy adults achieved deposition ef\ufb01ciencies >70% in the whole lung and >50% in", "m droplet bolus of 300\u2013900 mL) is slowly inhaled at 8 liters min\u22121, followed 10 s later by a rapid inspiratory \ufb02ow rate of 30 liters min\u22121. This procedure imposed on 10 healthy adults achieved deposition ef\ufb01ciencies >70% in the whole lung and >50% in the lung periphery. The nasal pathway is a popular drug-aerosol delivery route to treat congestion and allergies. Presently, it is considered an alternative to drug ingestion and injection, especially for pain man- agement and diseases associated with the central nervous system, which requires targeting the olfactory channels, whereas reaching the middle meatus is important for the effective treatment of chronic sinusitis. Nasal cavity\u2013deposited drugs can further advance via passive trans- or para- cellular diffusion, carrier/receptor-mediated transport, or endocytosis across the nasal mucosa. Approaches for increasing the drug residence time to assure tissue transfer are discussed by Turker et al. (124). There are three major problems in controlled drug-aerosol deposition that have to be addressed, i.e., the complex airway geometry implying the hard-to-reach olfactory region for particle deposition, the problems with small monodisperse droplet generation, and the signi\ufb01cant loss of drug-aerosols to the lung. Although the effective length of human nasal cavities is only 10 cm, they feature a wide array of complex \ufb02ow phenomena because of their intricate geometrics. For example, Shi et al. (68) showed that the olfactory region receives only 14.4%\u201317.4% of the 208 Kleinstreuer\u00b7 Zhang\u00b7 Donohue", "ang\u00b7 Donohue", "Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org.

Com- mercial nasal sprays have large droplets (i.e., 50\u201370 \u03bcm), which are trapped in the narrow anterior valve region and typically never reach the olfactory channels. Reduction of droplet size to, for example, 5\u201310 \u03bcm increases local deposition ef\ufb01ciencies, but it also increases the risk of letting signi\ufb01cant drug portions travel into the lung, leading potentially to adverse side effects. Several new nasal spray and particle formulations as well as new nasal drug delivery devices have been developed to overcome some of the shortcomings mentioned above (125\u2013129). Two intrigu- ing ideas are the controlled particle dispersion technology employing vortical air\ufb02ow for enhanced particle dispersion (130) and the bidirectional delivery system, which avoids drug-aerosol escape into the lung (131). Although these novel techniques/devices augment drug-aerosol deposition past the nasal valve area, they are again nondirectional. METHODOLOGY FOR OPTIMAL DRUG-AEROSOL TARGETING As mentioned, present R&D efforts concerning NSs, pMDIs, and DPIs concentrate on measur- able improvements in terms of most suitable formulation and drug-aerosol delivery to speci\ufb01c airway regions as well as device ease of use, reliability, and cost. Still, two major problem areas as- sociated with existing devices are directional targeting of suitable aerolized drugs to predetermined deposition sites and intersubject variability. It should be noted that some of these R&D goals are echoed by asthma pat", " two major problem areas as- sociated with existing devices are directional targeting of suitable aerolized drugs to predetermined deposition sites and intersubject variability. It should be noted that some of these R&D goals are echoed by asthma patients and healthcare professionals. Speci\ufb01cally, an ideal inhaler features the following characteristics (93): \u201caccurate and consistent in effective drug delivery; easy and convenient to use; easy to teach, learn and remember how to use correctly; capable of delivering a range of drugs; accurate dose counter; patient feedback of dose taken; convenient to carry; robust; visually appealing to the patient; easily identi\ufb01able in terms of the drug/strength contained in the inhaler; and propellant-free.\u201d Smart Inhaler System Methodology In cases where expensive and/or aggressive drug aerosols have to reach a speci\ufb01c site in the lung (e.g., to coat a tumor), a speci\ufb01c deep-lung region (e.g., to achieve rapid drug absorption of, for example, insulin), or the olfactory bulb (e.g., to bring morphine quickly past the blood- brain barrier for pain management), targeted drug-aerosol delivery is most desirable. This can be achieved with a new, patient-speci\ufb01c controlled air-particle stream methodology. Predeter- mined sites, associated with a speci\ufb01c disease or treatment, can be targeted with an appropri- ate inhaled air-stream with suitable drug-aerosol characteristics, in terms of density, size, and concentration, as well as release position (104). The necessary device to generate such patient- speci\ufb01c, controlled air-particle streams is discussed by Kleinstreuer & Seelecke on their Web site (http://urweb.tv/UNC/smartinhaler.html).

Speci\ufb01c case studies for mouth and nose inhalation of drug aerosols illustrate the underlying methodology for future smart inhaler systems (SISs). Oral Inhalation Case Studies As a \ufb01rst example, an upper airway model consisting of the oral airway model and a symmetric, triple-bifurcation lung airway model representing generations G0 (trachea) to G3 (see Figure 5) was employed to investigate the transport of inhaled drug-aerosols. The detailed description of this upper airway model can be found in Zhang et al. (28, 69).

One thousand particles were released at the oral inlet. The experimental measurements, a proof-of-concept, were conducted in-house using a Mie scattering technique. The simulated particle distributions agree well with the experimental visualizations. Minor discrepancies may be attributed to (a) slight differences in inlet releasepositionsbetweenthesimulationsandexperiments;(b)differencesinvisualizationlocations; (c) differences in the geometries (for example, there was a transition tube in the experimental setup and the airway geometry becomes slightly different after manufacturing); and (d ) the difference in air humidity, particle size, and \ufb02ow rate, i.e., particle distributions are sensitive to factors (a) and (b). The speci\ufb01c inlet positions of aerosols that land on different targeted sites are determined via backtracking and then release-controlled air-particle streams are generated so that most aerosols deposit in the desired lung regions, e.g., in\ufb02amed left or right lower airways, etc. Speci\ufb01cally, depositions of 7-\u03bcm particles with a relatively low inhalation \ufb02ow rate (i.e., 8 liters min\u22121) are minor in the upper airways due to negligible inertial impaction (i.e., deposition fractions were DForal = 1.47%, and DFG0\u22123 = 0.76%). Thus, most of them can enter the deeper lung regions. In general, particles released from the left and right sides of the circular mouth entrance enter the left and right lungs, respectively. However, the inlet positions of particles leaving different d", "s, most of them can enter the deeper lung regions. In general, particles released from the left and right sides of the circular mouth entrance enter the left and right lungs, respectively. However, the inlet positions of particles leaving different daughter-branch exits of G3 vary irregularly due to the effects of secondary \ufb02ows. An SIS with a \ufb02exible nozzle for optimal particle-stream ejection could readily target any lung site of any individual if the speci\ufb01c lung morphology is obtained beforehand, as discussed above. However, such an SIS would be rather complex. A simpler technique for an inhaler based on the new drug-aerosol targeting methodology is particle-release from orbit points with one or more critical radii. In this second case study, a tube- aligned nozzle with adjustable particle-outlet diameter can rotate on a predetermined orbital path. For example, the targeted regions for release positions 1 to 4 shown in Figure 7 are located in the lower airways after generation G3 (see Figure 8 and Table 2). Approximately 3000 particles were released from each position at the oral inlet. Particles leaving from G31 and G34 may enter side and central parts of the left lung, respectively, while they transport into side and central portions of the right lung after exiting from G35 and G38 (see Figure 5).

Distributions of particles entering targeted (outlet) airways are depicted in Figure 8. Some particle dispersion occurs for inlet positions 2 to 4 because of the in\ufb02uence of secondary \ufb02ows and lack of humidity. In contrast, inlet position 1 is located in a larger particle release area reaching the G31 airway outlet. In any case, dispersion could be greatly avoided when using drug aerosols with mildly attractive surface properties via surfactant coating. Furthermore, the relatively high-humidity environment in lung airways should reduce micron-particle dispersion. Nasal Inhalation Technique The best approach for optimal drug-aerosol targeting in the nasal airways would be a combination of methodologies of bidirectional circulation (BDC) and controlled air-particle stream (CAPS). Speci\ufb01cally, BDC relies on the anatomical fact that during exhalation against a resistance, the soft palate closes (131), thereby separating the nasal cavities from the oral airways. Although the soft palate is shutting off the oral pharynx, the two nasal cavities still communicate via the passageway www.annualreviews.org \u2022 Targeted Drug-Aerosol Delivery 213", "pharynx, the two nasal cavities still communicate via the passageway www.annualreviews.org \u2022 Targeted Drug-Aerosol Delivery 213", "Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org.

Thus, a person blowing into a device, which redirects the air\ufb02ow into one nostril, can initiate an air-particle stream that circulates in a U-turn between the two nasal cavities. Now, injecting at a slightly delayed time, the controlled particle jet, powder stream, or droplet spray, adjusted to the air velocity, will result in high drug-aerosol retention and optimal targeting. Focusing on the more complicated nasal sprays, the best air\ufb02ow rate is in the range of 10 < Q < 20 liters min\u22121, whereas the most suitable drug-aerosol release depends on optimal particle properties (i.e., mainly size, shape, density, and surface characteristics) as well as optimal spray parameters in terms of the droplet mean velocity, spray-cone angle, injection angle, and release position. Again, most of these parameters can be determined via backtracking. Speci\ufb01cally, computer experiments with thousands of suitable particles are conventionally injected in a con- trolled air stream and then the release conditions of those that landed at the predetermined site are recorded (132). CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS Inhalation of drug aerosols is a modern pathway to combat lung diseases. It is also", "cted in a con- trolled air stream and then the release conditions of those that landed at the predetermined site are recorded (132). CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS Inhalation of drug aerosols is a modern pathway to combat lung diseases. It is also becoming the preferred route for insulin delivery, pain management, cancer therapy, and nanotherapeutics. Pop- ular delivery devices include nebulizers, metered-dose inhalers, and dry-powder inhalers. They are all nondirectional and hence have typically low particle deposition ef\ufb01ciencies in desired nasal or lung areas. Thus, for speci\ufb01c disease treatment with costly and/or aggressive medicine, it is nec- essary to provide targeted drug-aerosol delivery to predetermined sites in the human respiratory system. Experimental measurements and computer models of particle transport and deposition in nasal and lung airway models are presented. Furthermore, the underlying methodology and performance of pressurized metered dose inhalers as well as new smart inhaler systems are dis- cussed. To maximize respiratory drug delivery to speci\ufb01c sites, an optimal combination of particle characteristics, inhalation waveform, particle release position, and drug-aerosol dosage has to be achieved. The two connected problems of optimal drug-aerosol delivery and intersubject variability will be resolved with the advent of routine petascale computing and reliable SIS technology. 214 Kleinstreuer\u00b7 Zhang\u00b7 Donohue", "Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org.

Hence, via backtrack- ing from the known target site, a controlled air-particle stream and associated drug-aerosol re- lease/inhalation conditions can be determined for optimal delivery of medicine to the lung or nasal airways, using a suitable SIS device. Although such a routine application of modern medical management for each patient is still in the future, a simpler SIS device based on the particle-release from orbital points (see second oral inhalation case study, above) is already feasible. In summary, to reach the goal of targeted drug-aerosol delivery in the human respiratory system, medical device and pharmaceutical industries as well as academia and funding agencies have to collaborate.

Despite the established success of systemic NP delivery in oncology and other disciplines, the exploration of inhaled NP therapies remains relatively nascent. NPs loaded with bronchodilators or anti-inflammatory agents exhibit promising potential for precise distribution throughout the bronchial tree, offering targeted treatment for respiratory diseases. This article conducts a comprehensive review of NP applications in respiratory medicine, highlighting their merits, ranging from heightened stability to exacting lung-specific delivery. It also explores cutting-edge technologies optimizing NP-loaded aerosol systems, complemented by insights gleaned from clinical trials. Furthermore, the review examines the current challenges and future prospects in NP-based therapies. By synthesizing current data and perspectives, the article underscores the transformative promise of NP-mediated drug delivery in addressing chronic conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a pressing global health concern ranked third in mortality rates. This overview illuminates the evolving landscape of NP inhalation therapies, presenting optimistic avenues for advancing respiratory medicine and improving patient outcomes. Keywords: nanoparticles; inhalation; therapy; applications 1. Introduction Respiratory disorders, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and various infections, pose significant challenges to global health. With 454.6 mil- lion cases worldwide, chronic respiratory disorders accounted for 4.0 million deaths in 2019 and were the third most common cause of death [1]. Traditional therapies, though effective to some extent, often face limitations such as systemic side effects, poor", "es worldwide, chronic respiratory disorders accounted for 4.0 million deaths in 2019 and were the third most common cause of death [1]. Traditional therapies, though effective to some extent, often face limitations such as systemic side effects, poor bioavailability, and suboptimal drug targeting. Since Richard Adolf Zsigmondy won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1925 for his pioneering work on colloids\u2014a particular kind of nanoparticle (NP)\u2014NPs have gained significant attention [2]. But in the last few decades the field of study has seen remarkable growth and development, leading to their widespread use in a range of industries and significant potential in medical applications. Global regula- tory entities have been actively involved in evaluating and certifying NPs for a variety of applications. Although the exact number of NP-based products approved by regulatory agencies is unclear, significant progress has been made in this area. Regulatory bodies such as the World Health Organization and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have implemented stringent guidelines to ensure the safe and effective use of NPs in medical applications. These regulations play a crucial role in balancing innovation with patient Pharmaceuticals 2024, 17, 1059. https://doi.org/10.3390/ph17081059 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceuticals", "Pharmaceuticals 2024, 17, 1059 2 of 29 safety, fostering the development of novel NP-based therapies while mitigating potential risks [3,4]. The FDA defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of materials between 1 and 100 nm (0.001\u20130.1 \u00b5m) in size [5]. Also, the European Union has established guide- lines and regulations concerning the use of NPs [6]. These efforts underscore a continued commitment to integrating nanotechnology into consumer and medical products while up- holding stringent safety standards. Robust laws and regulations are essential to guarantee the safe and responsible application of NPs and nanomaterials across various industries, including medicine. In recent years, significant strides have been made in NP-based drug delivery systems (DDS) tailored for respiratory diseases. Innovative delivery systems, including nebulizers, pressurized metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs), soft-mist inhalers (SMIs), and dry powder inhalers (DPIs), have been engineered to optimize drug delivery efficiency. These systems offer advantages such as improved drug stability, controlled release kinetics, and enhanced lung deposition, addressing critical limitations of traditional inhalation therapies [7\u201310]. NP-based DDS represent a significant advancement in respiratory medicine, offering a transformative approach to the treatment of chronic and acute respiratory diseases. By addressing the limitations of traditional therapies, these innovative systems hold the potential to revolutionize the management of respiratory conditions, ultimately improving patient care and quality of life [10]. By synthesizing evidence from key academic databases, including Scopus, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science, this review seeks to underscore the transforma- tive potential of NP-DDS in impr", "tely improving patient care and quality of life [10]. By synthesizing evidence from key academic databases, including Scopus, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science, this review seeks to underscore the transforma- tive potential of NP-DDS in improving therapeutic outcomes and advancing respiratory healthcare, with a specific focus on the terms \u201cnanoparticles\u201d, \u201cinhalation\u201d, \u201ctherapy\u201d, and \u201capplications\u201d. 2. NP Inhaled Therapies: Key Advantages Inhaled therapies are crucial for treating respiratory disorders due to the extensive surface area of the lungs, totaling approximately 140 m2 at the alveolar level [11]. This anatomical feature ensures direct access to a dense vascular network, highlighting the necessity for effective DDS that target specific lung regions while minimizing systemic side effects through dose reduction [12]. NPs, typically sized under 1 micrometer and often within the nanometer range, play a crucial role in achieving these objectives. Their small size facilitates deep lung penetration, enhancing drug absorption, bioavailability, solubility, and diffusion kinetics [13]. Recent systematic reviews emphasize the efficacy of NP inhalation therapies, which achieve higher drug deposition in the lungs than conventional methods [12\u201314]. This targeted approach is particularly advantageous for diseases necessitating precise drug localization, such as respiratory infections and localized inflammation. Between 12% and 40% of the administered dose reaches the lungs, with approximately 20% to 25% of the medication remaining within the inhalation device [15\u201317], underscoring ongoing optimization opportunities. Smaller drug dimensions facilitate deeper penetration into peripheral and distal lung regions, as larger particles (>10 \u00b5m) are confined to larger airway", "remaining within the inhalation device [15\u201317], underscoring ongoing optimization opportunities. Smaller drug dimensions facilitate deeper penetration into peripheral and distal lung regions, as larger particles (>10 \u00b5m) are confined to larger airways. Particle size optimization is critical: particles sized between 1\u20135 \u00b5m target small airways effectively [18,19], while those under 500 nm reach alveolar sites via Brownian diffusion [20]. NPs smaller than 200 nm demonstrate effective targeting of respiratory epithelial cells while evading macrophage clearance and rapid cellular uptake, essential for sustained therapeutic efficacy [21,22]. The mucus layer, with pore sizes ranging from 100 to 500 nm, selectively traps aerosols based on size due to its adhesive properties. However, particles smaller than 100 nm may migrate toward central airways and potentially exit the respiratory tract [23]. Furthermore, NPs serve as efficient carriers for therapeutic molecules such as micro RNAs (miRNAs), showing promise in treating diverse respiratory disorders, including cancers, ischemic stroke, and pulmonary fibrosis [24]. Upon reaching target areas, effec- tive aerosol behavior involves evading local elimination mechanisms such as sneezing,", "Pharmaceuticals 2024, 17, 1059 3 of 29 swallowing, mucociliary clearance, surfactant layers, and macrophage phagocytosis at the alveolar level [25]. When designing nanoparticles for inhalation, several crucial factors must be consid- ered to ensure both their effectiveness and safety (Table 1) [26]. First, biocompatibility is essential, as the nanoparticles need to interact safely with biological systems. They should also be biodegradable so they break down naturally without causing harm. Efficient cellular uptake is important for their effectiveness in entering cells, while controlled release mechanisms allow for precise drug delivery over time. Cost-effectiveness is key for scaling up production and ensuring economic viability. Understanding the dose response and maintaining dose uniformity is important for assessing how the administered dose impacts biological responses and ensuring consistent drug delivery. The capacity for drug loading affects how much drug can be incorporated into the nanoparticles, which impacts their therapeutic effectiveness. It\u2019s also crucial to consider the immune response to prevent unwanted immune reactions. The mass median aerodynamic diameter is significant for ensuring that nanoparticles reach the lungs effectively, with the fine particle fraction be- ing vital for penetrating deeper lung regions. Pharmacokinetics involves studying the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of nanoparticles within the body. Ef- ficient production processes are necessary for cost-effective manufacturing, while safety involves evaluating potential toxicity and health risks. Sustainable production practices are important for minimizing environmental impact, and mucosal penetration is critical for effective drug delivery across mucosal barriers.", "turing, while safety involves evaluating potential toxicity and health risks. Sustainable production practices are important for minimizing environmental impact, and mucosal penetration is critical for effective drug delivery across mucosal barriers. Entrapment efficiency reflects how well the drug is encapsulated within the nanoparticles, and ensuring stability during airflow is crucial. Reducing the rate of nanoparticle clearance from the body and optimizing lung deposition enhance the effectiveness of drug delivery, while a sustained release profile ensures long-lasting therapeutic effects.

Figure 1 highlights key characteristics of nanoparticles that are vital for their applica- tion and performance. Figure 1. Nanoparticle characteristics. Chemical stability ensures nanoparticles remain unchanged under different condi- tions. Dispersibility refers to their ability to spread evenly in airflow. Physical stability maintains their structure over time, avoiding aggregation or degradation. The shape and size, measured in nanometers, impact their behavior and effectiveness. Surface charge af- fects interactions with other substances, while surface functionalization enhances targeting capabilities. Particle-particle interactions influence stability and dispersion. Lastly, low inertia is crucial for applications involving airflow, ensuring nanoparticles follow airflow patterns effectively. 3.

Advances in Technology and Delivery Systems Since their introduction in clinical trials in the early 1990s [28], NPs have been ex- plored extensively for their potential in targeted drug delivery to the lungs, addressing challenges such as limited bioavailability and systemic side effects. Two primary meth- ods are employed for delivering NPs to the lungs: aerosolization of solid microparticles utilizing a Trojan Horse strategy and nebulization of nanosuspensions dispersed in micron- sized droplets via nebulizers [29,30]. Studies suggest that approximately 50% of nebulized substances are effectively inhaled, highlighting ongoing optimization needs [31].", "Pharmaceuticals 2024, 17, 1059 5 of 29 3.1. Advances in Types of NPs Used Most inhaled NPs predominantly accumulate and release slowly in the alveolar region. Recent studies in NP-based inhalation therapies aim to minimize side effects, enhance therapeutic effectiveness, and optimize lung-specific drug delivery.

Lipid-NPs (LNPs) LNPs have emerged as versatile carriers in inhalation therapy, leveraging their unique structure and properties to enhance drug delivery efficiency and therapeutic outcomes in respiratory medicine. LNPs consist of various components, including ionizable lipids, solid and liquid lipids, and surfactants that play a crucial role in facilitating endosomal membrane binding and subsequent cytosolic release of encapsulated therapeutic agents [32]. Also, cholesterol and polyethylene glycol-coated lipids are essential for complexing mRNA and facilitating in vivo delivery [63]. This lipid shell not only provides structural integrity but also ensures stability in aqueous environments, which is crucial for the protection and controlled release of encapsulated drugs within the respiratory tract. In addition, LNPs can b", "y [63]. This lipid shell not only provides structural integrity but also ensures stability in aqueous environments, which is crucial for the protection and controlled release of encapsulated drugs within the respiratory tract. In addition, LNPs can be functionalized with targeting ligands, such as peptides or antibodies, allowing specific recognition and binding to receptors on lung epithelial cells or affected tissues, thereby enhancing therapeutic efficacy and minimizing off-target effects [34].", "Pharmaceuticals 2024, 17, 1059 7 of 29 LNPs offer a promising method for administering genetic therapies directly to lung tissues, presenting potential treatments for genetic conditions such as cystic fibrosis (CF) through gene correction. Research has shown that LNPs can be customized for efficient mRNA delivery to the lungs, emphasizing the necessity for stability during nebulization and effective penetration through mucus [64]. In oncology, LNPs play a crucial role in targeted drug delivery for lung cancer. By encapsulating chemotherapeutic agents or gene therapies, LNPs enable precise localization within lung tumors, enhancing therapeutic efficacy while minimizing systemic toxicity and adverse effects [65,66]. Furthermore, LNPs loaded with anti-inflammatory drugs or antibiotics hold promise for treating inflammatory lung diseases by delivering drugs directly to affected areas, thereby improving patient outcomes and quality of life [66,67]. Curcumin\u2019s anti-lung cancer effects are attributed to its potent antioxidant and anti- inflammatory properties, as well as its ability to enhance apoptosis [68] (Table 2). Inhalation delivery enhances topotecan exposure to lung tissue and improves its effectiveness against lung cancer [35]. Celecoxib was encapsulated in nanostructured lipid carriers, and their lung deposition in mice revealed that these carriers exhibited favorable fine particle fraction and mass median aerodynamic diameter [69]. Fluticasone propionate (FP)-loaded solid LNPs are more effective in managing oxidative stress compared to FP treatment alone [36]. Inhaled delivery of Irinotecan has shown promise, especially as a second-line therapy for small cell lung cancers (SCLCs) [37].

Inhaled delivery of Irinotecan has shown promise, especially as a second-line therapy for small cell lung cancers (SCLCs) [37]. NLD1, which incorporates high levels of PEG-lipid and cationic lipid helper, demonstrates that increasing PEG content in LNPs improves mRNA delivery to the lungs via nebulization [39]. The optimized lipid nanoparticles for nebulized mRNA delivery to the lungs have been shown to be more effective in preventing H1N1 in mice compared to systemic administration [39]. 3.1.2. Polymeric NPs (PNPs) PNPs, constructed from biocompatible and biodegradable polymers like chitosan or poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), offer significant promise for inhalation therapy. These PNPs have a core made of biodegradable polymers such as PLGA, poly(lactic acid) (PLA), chitosan, alginate, and polycaprolactone (PCL). These materials degrade into non-toxic by-products that are safely eliminated from the body. Surface modifications, similar to those used in LNPs, can be applied to PNPs to enhance targeting capabilities. Endocytosis is the primary mechanism for cellular uptake of polymeric NPs, leading to intra-lysosomal localization of the therapeutic agents [70]. The deposition of PNPs in the lungs is governed by mechanisms such as impaction, sedimentation, interception, and diffusion, each influenced by particle size. Impaction affects larger particles (>5 \u00b5m) in the upper respiratory tract, where airflow direction changes abruptly. Sedimentation impacts particles between 1 and 5 \u00b5m due to gravity, affecting the bronchi and bronchioles where airflow velocity decreases. Interception occurs when elongated particles or fibers of similar size to the airways follow the airstream closely and contact airway walls, particularly at bif", "m due to gravity, affecting the bronchi and bronchioles where airflow velocity decreases. Interception occurs when elongated particles or fibers of similar size to the airways follow the airstream closely and contact airway walls, particularly at bifurcations and in the bronchioles. Diffusion, influenced by the random Brownian motion of very small particles (<0.5 \u00b5m), predomi- nantly affects the alveolar region where airflow is minimal and distances to airway walls are short [29,39,40,71]. PNPs are generally safe for pulmonary administration due to their biocompatible and biodegradable nature, minimizing the risk of chronic toxicity. The controlled and sustained release of encapsulated drugs can be fine-tuned by altering the polymer composition and molecular weight. PNPs can encapsulate a broad spectrum of therapeutic agents, including small molecules, peptides, proteins, and nucleic acids (such as small interfering RNA- siRNA, short hairpin RNA, and miRNA), protecting them from degradation and enabling targeted delivery to specific lung cells, thereby increasing therapeutic efficacy and reducing systemic side effects [72].", "Pharmaceuticals 2024, 17, 1059 8 of 29 PNPs have diverse applications in inhalation therapy. They are used to administer anti-inflammatory agents to treat chronic respiratory conditions like asthma and COPD [73]. They can encapsulate antibiotics and antimicrobial agents to treat bacterial infections in the lungs, such as those caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in CF patients [74]. PNPs can deliver chemotherapeutic drugs directly into lung tumors, improving drug concentration at tumor sites while minimizing systemic toxicity [75]. They are also capable of delivering genetic material, such as DNA or RNA, into lung cells for gene therapy applications, providing potential treatments for genetic disorders like CF [76]. By integrating these advanced PNP technologies, inhalation therapies can achieve precise, effective, and safer treatments for various respiratory diseases, showcasing their potential to revolutionize pulmonary medicine. We outline key characteristics of PNPs that are specifically designed for delivery via inhalation in Table 3. Table 3. Characteristics of inhaled polymeric NPs.

Chitosan: Known for its positive charge and hydrogen-bonding capability, chitosan exhibits strong mucoadhesive properties [111]. This enables chitosan-based NPs to adhere to mucosal surfaces in the respiratory tract, extending their residence time and allowing for the prolonged release of encapsulated drugs. Inhaled chitosan NPs significantly en- hance bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy [40]. Studies highlight chitosan\u2019s ability to enhance cellular uptake via mechanisms such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis and caveolae-mediated endocytosis, which are crucial for delivering therapeutic payloads into target cells [77]. Beyond its adhesive properties, chitosan\u2019s biocompatibility and biodegrad- ability further contribute to its suitability for biomedical applications, particularly in DDS tailored for respiratory diseases. Gelatin: Gelatin possesses distinct isoelectric points and exhibits amphoteric activity, which enables it to facilitate cellular uptake and interact with mRNA in a cargo-dependent manner, thus ", ", particularly in DDS tailored for respiratory diseases. Gelatin: Gelatin possesses distinct isoelectric points and exhibits amphoteric activity, which enables it to facilitate cellular uptake and interact with mRNA in a cargo-dependent manner, thus facilitating endosomal release [51]. This makes gelatin-based nanomaterials suitable for delivering treatments for conditions like tuberculosis and for protein and mRNA delivery [49\u201351]. PLGA: While PLGA itself lacks strong mucoadhesive properties, surface modifications (e.g., chitosan coating) can enhance this feature. The polymer\u2019s characteristics, such as erosion time and hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance, can be tailored by adjusting the lac- tide/glycolide ratio and molecular weight. PLGA\u2019s versatility makes it suitable for various applications, including CF, asthma, and COPD treatments [78,83\u201388]. PLA: PLA-NPs degrade through hydrolysis of the ester bonds in their polymer frame- work. This degradation process is influenced by environmental variables such as pH and temperature, as well as the molecular weight of the polymer [88]. PLA-NPs are noted for their biocompatibility and biodegradability, which are crucial for their application in DDS. PLA-NPs are extensively studied for their ability to encapsulate and deliver a wide range of therapeutic agents effectively. They have been investigated in various biomedical applications, including drug delivery to treat respiratory diseases [88,89]. Their ability to undergo controlled degradation allows for sustained release of encapsulated drugs, which is advantageous for achieving therapeutic efficacy while minimizing adverse effects.

PEtOx: Poly(2-oxazoline) (PEtOx) is rapidly internalized by cells through endocytosis, with its rate adjustable via polymer structure modifications [91,112]. Its hydrophobic nature enhances cellular uptake, dispersing the polymer mainly in vesicular and perinuclear areas post-internalization [113]. PEtOx is noted for its unique physicochemical properties, non- toxicity, and stability [59,60,83,84]. PCL: PCL and PLGA can target the Golgi/endoplasmic reticulum, accumulating in late endosomes and Golgi-associated vesicles [96,114]. PCL\u2019s endocytic pathways make it effec- tive for treating pulmonary inflammatory diseases and pulmonary hypertension [97,98]. PEI: Polyethyleneimine (PEI) NPs adhere to the pulmonary epithelium and are inter- nalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis or macropinocytosis. PEI\u2019s high cationic charge", "Pharmaceuticals 2024, 17, 1059 10 of 29 density facilitates cellular absorption, allowing for sustained drug interactions [99]. PEI is used in gene therapy and lung tumor inhibition due to its efficient cellular uptake and endosomal escape capabilities [99\u2013102]. PS-NPs: Polystyrene NPs (PS-NPs) are highly versatile in DDS due to their stability, ease of functionalization, and biocompatibility. They primarily interact with cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis and caveolae-mediated endocytosis pathways, facilitating efficient internalization into target cells for drug delivery applications [103]. PS-NPs have emerged as promising candidates for delivering therapeutic agents to specific respiratory tissues [115]. They are particularly effective in treating respiratory diseases such as asthma and COPD, where their size and surface modifications can be tailored to enhance targeting and therapeutic efficacy [73,74,87]. These NPs exhibit high cellular uptake efficiency, making them ideal carriers for a range of drugs, including anti-inflammatory agents, antibiotics, and therapeutic proteins [104,105]. Beyond therapeutic applications, PS-NPs are explored for diagnostic imaging and targeted therapy. Surface modifications with ligands or antibodies enable PS-NPs to bind specifically to disease markers or receptors, facilitating precise imaging of lung tissues and guiding targeted therapeutic interventions [103]. PVA: Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) plays a crucial role in respiratory DDS by stabiliz- ing medications and forming effective NPs.

It enhances cellular uptake through vari- ous mechanisms like clathrin-mediated endocytosis, caveolae-mediated endocytosis, and macropinocytosis [116]. PVA-based NPs are used in inhalation therapy to stabilize and deliver drugs such as antibiotics and anti-inflammatory agents directly to the lungs. For example, PVA facilitates the microencapsulation of medications like vinpocetine, enhancing their efficacy when combined with dioctylsulfosuccinate sodium [117]. Additionally, PVA is essential for creating carrier-free dry powder inhalers for drugs such as ibuprofen, ensuring optimal drug release and particle sizes suitable for pulmonary administration. This poly- mer is particularly effective in treating respiratory infections and chronic conditions like CF [118]. Despite its benefits, the safety of inhaled PVA remains a concern due to potential risks highlighted in inhalation studies, including serious side effects such as pulmonary embolism associated with PVA microparticle embolotherapy interventions [118]. A higher aerosol performance, along with a sustained release profile, was achieved for PLGA nanoparticles loaded with 5% TAS-103 [42] (Table 2). A potential multifunctional polymeric vesicle combining PLGA and PEG has been proposed for delivering COPD medications, such as prednisolone and theophylline [44,119]. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles loaded with \u03b1-1-antitrypsin could be a promising formulation for the treat- ment of respiratory diseases [45]. Gel-BEGF demonstrated increased cellular uptake in EGFR-overexpressing cancer cell lines, showing significant promise for targeted lung cancer treatment [46].

Lomustine, a potent antineoplastic agent against the lung cancer cell line L132 showed excellent control of drug release [121]. Camptothecin- loaded poly(glycerolsuccinic acid) dendrimers were investigated as a potential carrier, leading to enhanced cytotoxicity against NSCLC (NCIH460) cells [122]. The novel peptide- dendrimer conjugate as a drug carrier was efficiently taken up by a lung tumor-bearing athymic mouse model [123]. Doxorubicin-loaded dendrimers enhanced anticancer efficacy in a lung metastasis model [124]. A similar approach was utilized to develop a DPI formu- lation by incorporating doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles into an inhalable carrier, where doxorubicin was incorporated into poly(butylcyanoacrylate) nanoparticles using emulsion techniques and coated with both polysorbate 80 and dextran [47]. Inhaled cisplatin dry pow- der has demonstrated activity against lung tumors in mice, inducing upregulation of PD-L1 on these tumors and enhancing the efficacy of anti-PD1 therapy in vivo by promoting the intratumoral recruitment of dendritic cells and T cells [125]. Polyethylene glycol-modified polylactic acid nanoparticles loaded with taxanes enhanced chemoradiation therapy both in vitro and in an A549 lung tumor xenograft model [126].", "Pharmaceuticals 2024, 17, 1059 11 of 29 3.1.3. Metallic NPs (MNPs) MNPs comprise metals tailored for specific applications in inhalation therapy. MNPs typically consist of a core of metal or metal oxide\u2014like gold, silver, iron, or zinc\u2014enhanced with surface modifications such as functional groups, polymers, or biological molecules (peptides or antibodies) to optimize stability, biocompatibility, and target specificity. MNPs exhibit unique properties beneficial for respiratory medicine, including cell wall interaction, membrane penetration, reactive oxygen species production, DNA damage, and inhibition of protein synthesis. These characteristics make MNPs promising candidates for developing novel antibacterial agents effective against antibiotic-resistant pathogens. For example, aerosolized gold NPs administered via endotracheal delivery in animal models demonstrate potential for systemic drug delivery, minimizing off-target effects associated with repeated cytotoxic therapies [127]. However, inhaling MNPs carries inherent health risks. Research indicates that expo- sure to metal oxide NPs, including zinc, copper, nickel, and magnesium, can exacerbate allergies by releasing metal ions and inducing inflammation [128]. Additionally, NPs de- rived from combustion sources such as diesel exhaust particles can cause oxidative stress and inflammation in the lungs, worsening cardiovascular and respiratory conditions [129]. High concentrations of metal oxide fumes, such as those from activities like gunfire, have been linked to lung cell damage, inflammation, immune activation, and systemic effects such as platelet activation and blood coagulation [130]. In respiratory medicine, magnetic MNPs offer versatile applications due to their small size and high surface area-to-volume rat", "ell damage, inflammation, immune activation, and systemic effects such as platelet activation and blood coagulation [130]. In respiratory medicine, magnetic MNPs offer versatile applications due to their small size and high surface area-to-volume ratio. These properties make them effective carriers for drug delivery, enabling the overcoming of biological barriers within the respiratory system to enhance therapeutic efficacy [131]. Specifically, inhaled MNPs show great promise in combating multidrug-resistant organisms in lower respiratory tract infections. Additionally, the unique characteristics of MNPs facilitate their use in personalized and targeted drug delivery strategies for various respiratory disorders, including asthma, COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, and lung infections [132]. Moreover, MNPs like silver, gold, and copper exhibit notable antiviral properties, including against viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. This makes them valuable components in nanomedicine-based drug delivery systems aimed at targeted therapy for respiratory diseases, including COVID-19 [133]. Cisplatin-loaded magnetic nanoparticles increased the cytotoxicity of cisplatin in a cisplatin-resistant A549 lung tumor xenograft model [134]. Methotrexate-loaded gold nanoparticles demonstrated increased tumor retention and improved therapeutic efficacy in a Lewis lung carcinoma model [135]. Quercetin-loaded Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles coated with PLGA are well-suited for targeting lung cancer cells through nebulization [136]. 3.1.4.

Their optimal designs and electronic properties have been computationally investigated, highlighting the impact of functionalization on stability and reactivity [138]. Silica NPs possess a high specific surface area, adjustable pore structure, and easy surface modification capabilities [139]. In biomedical applications, silica NPs serve as carriers for anti-inflammatory drugs, enabling localized delivery of high drug doses with minimized side effects and improved biodistribution [140]. Loaded with therapeutic drugs like dexamethasone, they effectively treat airway inflammation when administered via inhalation [141]. Their ability to enhance dissolution and intracellular drug release makes them suitable for dispersed liquid drop dosage forms and dry powder inhalers, which are crucial for pulmonary drug delivery [55]. Silica-modified NPs are also used in inhalation chemotherapy for lung diseases, maintaining high drug concentrations in the lungs and showing promise in disease therapy [142]. Additionally, they are employed with antimicrobial agents to combat antimicrobial resistance and biofilm development, offering solutions to enhance treatment outcomes [56]. Silica NPs have demonstrated", "Pharmaceuticals 2024, 17, 1059 12 of 29 potential in delivering genetic material such as siRNA for treating genetic disorders like CF [143,144] and targeting KRAS-mutant lung cancer [145]. Inhaled mesoporous silica nanoparticles were used for targeted drug delivery to the lungs, showing a reduction in TNF-\u03b1 release [146] (Table 2). Research shows that SiO2 particles can disrupt EGFR signaling in lung epithelial cells, affecting drug uptake, while ultrasmall core-shell silica nanoparticles enhance the delivery and efficacy of anticancer drugs like gefitinib, leading to reduced tumor growth and extended survival in non-small cell lung cancer models [147,148]. 3.1.5. Quantum Dots (QDs) QDs used in pulmonary applications feature varied compositions, often enhanced with surface-modifying chemicals like thiol, alkoxy, and cycloalkyl groups to optimize their imaging and drug delivery capabilities [149]. These QDs are further coated with specific oligomers or polymers via tailored chemical reactions to enhance tissue targeting and traceability within the body. QDs possess unique optical and electronic properties, coupled with chemically active surfaces, ideal for advanced imaging and precise drug delivery applications [150,151]. They enable optical tracing for diagnosing lung diseases, detecting microbial infections, and identifying lung cancer when administered via inhalation [57,150]. Modified QDs, decorated with ligands such as folic acid, have shown promise as targeted DDS for directing therapeutics like doxorubicin to specific receptors on human adenocarci- noma basal alveolar epithelial cells [152]. In biomedical research, QDs are versatile tools utilized for cell tracking, intracellular delivery, immunolabeling, gene delivery, cellular imaging, and motility assays [153,1", "receptors on human adenocarci- noma basal alveolar epithelial cells [152]. In biomedical research, QDs are versatile tools utilized for cell tracking, intracellular delivery, immunolabeling, gene delivery, cellular imaging, and motility assays [153,154]. Their capabilities extend to targeting the nucleus for diagnostic purposes and achieving high sensitivity for miRNA targeting, underscoring their potential in cutting-edge biomedical applications. Pulmonary delivery of EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor)-targeted SPIO (Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide) nanoparticles improved tumor retention and significantly inhibited lung tumor growth through hyperthermic destruction of NSCLC [155] (Table 2). Inhaled quantum dots, such as CdSe and CdTe, are explored for managing lung diseases like microbial infections and lung cancer and targeting alveolar macrophages [150]. 3.1.6. Protein-Based NPs (PBNPs) PBNPs utilize proteins as their primary structural component, forming well- defined hollow structures such as virus capsids, ferritin, and chaperonins through self- assembly [58,156,157]. These NPs offer unique advantages, including excellent receptor selectivity, biocompatibility, and biodegradability [58,158]. PBNPs are suitable for drug delivery applications due to their optimal size for endocytosis, low toxicity, predictable activity profiles, and the ability to functionalize at various interfaces [58,159]. They are particularly promising for incorporating therapeutic enzymes like proteases and endosomal escape enzymes, known for their specificity and efficacy in treating diseases [160].

In respiratory medicine, PBNPs made from proteins like albumin, gelatin, and soy protein are administered via inhalation for conditions such as asthma, COPD, and acute respiratory distress syndrome [59]. These proteins facilitate drug delivery with minimal immunogenicity and allow selective modification of NPs with tumor-specific ligands for targeted therapy [161,162]. For instance, incorporating antibiotics such as gentamicin and ciprofloxacin into soy protein isolate arrays enhances targeted drug delivery, protecting drugs from degradation and enabling controlled release [131,163]. PBNPs also play a role in anticancer therapy, with FDA-approved inhaled protein biologics like Pulmozyme demonstrating their efficacy [164]. Moreover, advancements in protein engineering have led to PBNPs designed for gene therapy applications using modular protein engineering and virus-like particles [165]. However, a challenge with using proteins as drug carriers is their susceptibility to degradation from temperature fluctuations and shear stress during manufacturing or storage [166].", "Pharmaceuticals 2024, 17, 1059 13 of 29 Inhaled paclitaxel-loaded bovine serum albumin microparticle dry powders demon- strated selective interaction with adenocarcinoma cells and significant tumor growth inhi- bition in a mouse model of lung cancer [167] (Table 2). A nano-drug delivery system using targeting ligand-modified albumin demonstrated enhanced antitumor efficacy against tumor growth and lung metastasis in mice, underscoring the potential of inhaled protein- based formulations for effective cancer treatment [168]. 3.1.7. Inorganic NPs Inhaled inorganic NPs encompass tiny particles of substances like cerium oxide (CNPs) and calcium phosphate, each offering distinct structural and functional properties [60,61]. CNPs consist of cerium atoms in two oxidation states (Ce3+ and Ce4+), exhibiting magnetic, electronic, and multi-enzyme mimetic activities that combat intracellular reactive oxygen species [169]. Calcium phosphate NPs, including hydroxyapatite and tricalcium phosphate, are noted for their biocompatibility, biodegradability, pH-dependent solubility, and drug and nucleic acid (plasmid DNA, siRNA, miRNA, etc.) binding capabilities, making them promising for drug delivery applications [170]. CNPs find utility in cancer therapy due to their ability to induce oxidative stress and damage in lung cancer cells [171]. Surface modification with amorphous silica aims to mitigate potential toxicity, enhancing safety profiles [172]. Studies have shown that CNPs coated with microRNA-146a can protect against acute lung injury induced by bleomycin, reducing inflammation and oxidative stress while preserving lung function [173]. Inhaled cerium phosphate nanoparticles play a significant role in the lungs by precipitating in phagolysosomal regions within macrophages (Table 2", " induced by bleomycin, reducing inflammation and oxidative stress while preserving lung function [173]. Inhaled cerium phosphate nanoparticles play a significant role in the lungs by precipitating in phagolysosomal regions within macrophages (Table 2) [174]. 3.1.8. Exosome-Mimetic NPs (EMNPs) EMNPs are synthetic structures designed to replicate the natural functions and struc- ture of exosomes, small vesicles crucial for intercellular communication and cargo delivery in cells. These EMNPs are typically fabricated through extrusion, artificial synthesis, or li- posome fusion, incorporating proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids found in natural exosomes such as messenger RNAs, noncoding RNAs, and DNA [175,176]. EMNPs offer several advantages in drug delivery. Their lipid bilayer structure protects therapeutic compounds from degradation, ensuring stability and sustained release at the target site. They exhibit high biocompatibility and low immunogenicity, minimizing the risk of adverse immune reactions and enabling precise targeting capabilities. Compared to natural exosomes, EMNPs are more stable, maintaining integrity and functionality during administration and storage [177]. In respiratory medicine, inhaled EMNPs hold significant promise. They have demon- strated anticancer effects by encapsulating chemotherapeutic drugs like paclitaxel within T cell-derived exosomes modified with chimeric antigen receptors, effectively targeting specific cancer cells and reducing tumor growth [178]. Studies in mice have shown that lung-derived extracellular vesicles, when inhaled, distribute mRNA and protein cargo effectively in lung tissues, enhancing bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy [178].

Ad- ditionally, inhalable virus-like EMNPs decorated with the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain are being explored as potential COVID-19 vaccine candidates, triggering robust immune responses in animal models and showing stability at room temperature [62]. EM- NPs can also carry anti-inflammatory agents for treating lung diseases characterized by inflammation, as well as anti-fibrotic agents to reduce fibrosis and scarring in pulmonary tissues, potentially halting the progression of conditions like pulmonary fibrosis [179,180]. Exosomes have been developed for the delivery of Curcumin to treat lung and breast cancer (Table 2) [181]. F-EMNs loaded with RNAs are utilized in lung disease therapy to enhance targeted delivery of RNA therapeutics and improve therapeutic outcomes through precise gene modulation [182].", "Pharmaceuticals 2024, 17, 1059 14 of 29 3.1.9. Nanocrystals/Nanosuspensions Nanocrystals are partially amorphous pharmaceutical structures with sizes ranging from 100 to 1000 nm, formed through molecular aggregation. They are designed to enhance solubility, adhesiveness, and distribution in the respiratory tract [183]. Additionally, the large surface area of nanocrystals allows for better absorption and prolonged residence time in the respiratory tract [184]. Suspended nanocrystals of budesonide have been utilized for nebulized treatment of cholesterol-responsive lung diseases [185]. A study comparing the nebulization of budesonide nanocrystals with conventional budesonide formulations revealed that the neb- ulization time for nanoparticles was shorter, with a similar safety profile and pulmonary absorption rate [46]. Another study investigating the use of itraconazole nanosuspen- sions in patients with cystic fibrosis found that high concentrations were achieved and persisted for a long time in lung tissue [186]. However, the inhalation administration of nanocrystals/nanosuspensions has not yet been approved for routine clinical practice. 3.2. Advances in Delivery Systems Despite the promising potential of nanomolecules for inhalation therapy, relatively few studies have been successfully completed. Challenges such as the difficulty in ob- taining nanoparticles and achieving consistent and reproducible airway releases have slowed progress. Currently, research has largely focused on identifying the most effective carriers for inhalation therapy. However, given the rapid advancements in respiratory disease research, we anticipate an increase in studies showing superior results compared to traditional molecule administration methods.

However, given the rapid advancements in respiratory disease research, we anticipate an increase in studies showing superior results compared to traditional molecule administration methods. Moreover, we expect that gene therapy using inhaled nanoparticles will become a significant breakthrough, especially for treating conditions like cystic fibrosis and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. The safety and efficacy of administering small, precise doses will be a major advantage in this emerging field. Advanced techniques for inhaled NP delivery systems (INPDS) represent a significant advancement in overcoming biological barriers and controlling drug release. Despite the unique challenges of the pulmonary route, it offers promising opportunities for noninva- sive drug administration. Defined by the National Institutes of Health as medical devices for controlled release or targeted delivery, these systems typically involve biocompatible coatings that protect drugs from degradation [187,188]. INPDS provides several advan- tages, including precise targeting of drugs to the lungs, enhanced drug absorption and bioavailability, and reduced systemic exposure and side effects. They can encapsulate a wide range of therapeutic agents and ensure controlled and sustained drug release, which is crucial for protecting sensitive medications. Their non-invasive nature enhances patient compliance, and they can serve multifunctional roles by combining therapeutic and di- agnostic functions. Moreover, these systems effectively navigate biological barriers like mucus, making them highly effective in treating respiratory diseases and potentially other medical conditions [188].

DPIs DPIs deliver medication in a powdered form that becomes aerosolized upon inhala- tion, making them increasingly popular for NP delivery due to their user-friendly design, portability, and stability [189]. Ongoing research focuses on optimizing DPI formula- tions containing NPs by enhancing aerodynamic properties and ensuring redispersibility. Strategies like cryo-milling have been investigated to maintain drug stability and improve inhalation characteristics, demonstrating successful preservation of enzymatic activity even after extended storage periods [190]. The effectiveness of DPI formulations relies on critical factors such as particle size, shape, and surface area, which significantly impact aerodynamic properties and deposition efficiency in the lungs. To expedite the translation of NP-based DPI formulations from research to clinical use, addressing gaps in preclin-", "Pharmaceuticals 2024, 17, 1059 15 of 29 ical development and implementing robust bio-fate linking methodologies are crucial steps [191]. 3.2.2. MDIs MDIs use a propellant to deliver a specific dose of medication as a mist. To study the pulmonary delivery process and therapeutic outcome, a variety of DDS, including lipid-based nanocarriers [192,193], dendrimers, and polymeric nanocarriers [194], have been integrated with MDI. Also, PNPs play a significant role in DDS based on metered dose inhalation [195,196]. MDIs are crucial devices for administering medication for asthma and COPD, utilizing compressed propellants to generate aerosols [197]. These handheld devices can deliver pre- cise drug doses directly or via attachments such as spacers and valved holding chambers, which improve dose synchronization and facilitate inhalation over multiple breaths [197]. Some MDIs incorporate features like one-way valves and deflectable diaphragms to aid in proper inhalation and exhalation processes for patients. Advances include inhalers equipped with processors and memory for monitoring dose parameters and user feed- back, enhancing medication consumption effectiveness. NPs significantly enhance the performance and stability of MDIs. Research has explored various NP types, such as lipid nanocarriers, PNPs, dendrimers, and micelles, to effectively deliver pulmonary drugs [198]. An innovative approach involves using anhydrous reverse micelle NPs to mitigate sedimen- tation instability in peptide-containing pressurized MDIs, resulting in improved particle size, aerosolization properties, and storage stability [199]. 3.2.3.

Nebulizers Nebulizers transform liquid medication into a fine mist for inhalation through various types: jet nebulizers utilize compressed air, ultrasonic nebulizers employ ultrasonic waves, and vibrating mesh nebulizers use a vibrating mesh to generate the mist. Nebulizers play a pivotal role in delivering pulmonary medications, offering benefits such as ease of use, applicability across diverse patient groups, and visible spray for patient satisfaction [200]. Recent advancements in particle engineering have facilitated the creation of new inhaled nanosystems that enhance lung deposition and reduce pulmonary clearance, potentially transforming the treatment landscape for severe respiratory conditions like SARS-CoV- 2 [200]. Furthermore, innovative techniques such as electro-hydrodynamic nebulizers have emerged to produce and administer polymeric aerosols simultaneously, converting liquid solutions into polymeric particles ideally sized between 1\u20135 \u00b5m for effective lung drug delivery [201]. These innovations underscore the continuous evolution of nebulizer technology for NPs, aiming toward more efficient and targeted delivery of inhaled NPs and promising improved therapeutic outcomes. 3.2.4.

Nasal Sprays Nasal sprays deliver NPs through the nasal route, potentially facilitating delivery to the lungs. Nasal NPs are increasingly recognized for their potential to deliver vaccines and antiviral drugs, leveraging the nasal cavity\u2019s permeability and presence of immuno- competent cells [205]. These NPs enhance drug bioavailability, protect against enzymatic degradation, and facilitate drug transport across mucosal barriers. Research indicates their effectiveness in delivering antigens, eliciting robust immune responses without requiring adjuvants [206]. Furthermore, formulations like NanoSTING, encapsulated in liposomes, have demonstrated rapid activation of the innate immune system, offering broad-spectrum protection against respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza [206]. Thus, nasal NPs present a promising approach for efficient and targeted delivery of vaccines and antiviral drugs, with promising advantages in efficacy, safety, and ease of administration. 3.2.7. Nasal Nebulizers Nasal nebulizers are specialized devices designed to deliver aerosolized NPs through the nasal passages. Nasal nebulizers utilizing NPs show significant potential for enhancing drug delivery efficiency. Current research focuses on developing advanced NP formulations for intranasal use, aiming to surmount biological barriers and enhance drug bioavailabil- ity [207,208]. NPs, such as those based on chitosan, protect drugs from degradation, sustain release, and improve mucosal permeation, thereby enhancing the efficacy of vaccines and medications [209].

Discussion The practical application of inhaled medications faces numerous challenges that impact both the distribution of inhaled molecules in the bronchial tree and their absorption. Despite these challenges, numerous studies have explored the use of NPs in clinical practice for diagnostic (e.g., imaging) and therapeutic purposes. NPs show promise across various fields, notably in neoplastic pathologies such as lung, breast, and ovarian cancers. In these contexts, NPs are often administered intravenously, with notable examples including doxorubicin liposomes and albumin-bound paclitaxel [211,212]. Additionally, MNPs have demonstrated antimicrobial effects [213]. Medications administered via inhalation encounter specific and nonspecific defense mechanisms that can reduce their bioavailability. However, using NPs as drug carri- ers offers a way to bypass these protective mechanisms. Studies have shown that NPs can deposit in the lining fluid, protecting them from mucociliary clearance and alveolar macrophages [214]. Major classes of inhaled medications include corticosteroids, bron- chodilators (\u03b22 adrenergic and anticholinergic agents), and antibiotics, widely used in treating obstructive bronchopulmonary diseases like asthma and COPD. The recent SARS- CoV-2 pandemic has spurred research into inhalation NPs, with studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of inhaling exosomes in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and the impact of inhaling nanosilver on lung immune responses. Current research also investi- gates the therapeutic effects of inhaling colloidal silver or remdesivir NPs in COVID-19 patients [215].

For example, LNPs", "nt research also investi- gates the therapeutic effects of inhaling colloidal silver or remdesivir NPs in COVID-19 patients [215]. The success of mRNA in controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has revealed its potential in other areas. For example, LNPs carrying mRNA are being studied for aerosol delivery to patients with CF. Early results show stable lung function, with forced expiratory volume in the first second remaining stable after treatment, and administration safety has been confirmed [216]. Several molecules are already in clinical use, such as tobramycin, amikacin, and surfactant proteins SP-B and SP-C, utilizing liposomes or distearoylphosphatidylcholine as nanocarriers. Others, like plasmid DNA, are in various development stages [12]. Strong suppression of inflammation in allergic asthma has been achieved in phase I/II studies using interleukin-4 receptor subunit alpha (IL-4Ra) antagonists with lipocalin-1 nanocarriers. Prolonged bronchodilator effects have also been noted with Salbutamol sulfate administered via vesicular/niosomes delivery systems. Studies by Matsuo and Kenyon have shown that incorporating steroids (beclomethasone or dexamethasone) into NPs provides superior anti-inflammatory effects in asthma patients [217,218]. Biocompati- ble and biodegradable NP forms of beclomethasone (stealth nanosteroids) have reduced eosinophil counts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Encapsulated budesonide in experi- mental models has similarly reduced inflammation and bronchoconstriction, as measured by eosinophil peroxidase activity, eosinophil counts, and serum immunoglobulin E levels. Notably, weekly administration of liposomal NPs was as effective as daily budesonide ther- apy, potentially improving adherence and reducing side effects [219]. Similar reductions in", "ase activity, eosinophil counts, and serum immunoglobulin E levels. Notably, weekly administration of liposomal NPs was as effective as daily budesonide ther- apy, potentially improving adherence and reducing side effects [219]. Similar reductions in inflammatory cells have been observed with NP-containing budesonide therapy [203,220]. The administration of liposome aerosol particles has demonstrated efficient distribu- tion throughout the respiratory tract, sustained for up to 48 h, compared to salbutamol sulfate [221]. This suggests improved and prolonged bronchoconstriction control, with better deposition in the respiratory airways and reduced retention in the oropharynx [222]. Anti-inflammatory effects have been observed in studies using poloxamer 407-based nanoemulsions [223]. For instance, in vitro treatment of human basal epithelial cells sen- sitized to cigarette smoke resulted in the inactivation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the activation of anti-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting protective effects on the respira- tory mucosa. Other therapeutic options for managing chronic respiratory diseases involve using small noncoding RNA molecules, such as mature miRNAs [224]. In COPD, miR-146a shows promise for regulating inflammatory cytokines by suppress- ing IL-1R and Toll-like receptors. Nanotechnologies offer potential solutions for pulmonary", "Pharmaceuticals 2024, 17, 1059 18 of 29 antibiotic delivery, with PNPs, especially those based on lactic or glycolic acid, being pre- ferred for respiratory infections due to their biodegradability and lack of toxicity. These advantages have led to the approval of some PNPs, such as chitosan, for practical use. Inor- ganic nanoparticles like gold NPs and quantum dots also show significant potential [225]. A study by Rathnayake et al. demonstrated that liposome-encapsulated antibiotics release the active substance upon degradation by bacterial lipase in Pseudomonas aeruginosa infec- tions, effectively combating both extracellular and intracellular drug-resistant bacteria and offering a positive outlook on antibiotic resistance [226]. For developing inhalation therapies and evaluating device performance, clinical stud- ies utilize various methodologies to estimate drug distribution in the airways. Although in vitro activity does not always correlate with clinical response, understanding lung de- position is crucial. In silico studies, combining imaging with physical models of particle movement generates distribution patterns of inhaled particles. Computational and artificial intelligence-based approaches can predict interactions between inhaled molecules and biological structures, as well as the pharmacokinetic mechanisms involved [227]. An ongoing concern in current therapy is the likelihood of water-soluble nanoparticles causing side effects. Since data on the long-term neutralization and removal of nanopar- ticles are still limited, there are concerns about potential undesirable effects. Beyond endotoxic effects, there is also significant worry about the environmental impact, prompt- ing the introduction of risk mitigation measures for nanotechnology. Studies aimed at ", " limited, there are concerns about potential undesirable effects. Beyond endotoxic effects, there is also significant worry about the environmental impact, prompt- ing the introduction of risk mitigation measures for nanotechnology. Studies aimed at understanding tissue damage caused by the shape or chemical composition of nanoparticles are ongoing and include identifying biomarkers as toxicity sensors. The interaction of nanoparticles with alveolar macrophages could reduce their efficacy and increase the risk of infection. Therefore, during the synthesis of inhaled nanoparticles, bypassing alveolar macrophages to enhance the availability of administered molecules remains a key goal. Other cellular interactions, such as those with epithelial cells and fibroblasts, also warrant attention. Intracellular uptake of nanoparticles can lead to the gen- eration of oxygen free radicals and the release of cytokines, triggering a pro-inflammatory response [228]. Interaction with fibroblasts can contribute to the development of pulmonary fibrosis, while inflammation and an excess of free radicals may promote the formation of new lesions. The induction of inflammation could counteract anti-inflammatory medica- tions used for conditions like bronchial asthma and COPD, which would be undesirable. Current data suggest that nanoparticles based on silicon, carbon, silver, and zinc may cause adverse respiratory effects [229\u2013231]. Most studies are based on experimental models, and little is known about the effects in humans. It has been suggested that nanoparticles may accumulate in the pulmonary alveoli, potentially contributing to the development of pul- monary fibrosis [232]. Due to their small size, nanoparticles are likely to pass through the alveolocapillary membrane, potentially cau", "ed that nanoparticles may accumulate in the pulmonary alveoli, potentially contributing to the development of pul- monary fibrosis [232]. Due to their small size, nanoparticles are likely to pass through the alveolocapillary membrane, potentially causing systemic effects, particularly depending on their chemical structure.

Conclusions NPs are at the forefront of inhalation therapy research, with efforts focused on opti- mizing design, enhancing safety profiles, and maximizing therapeutic efficacy for various pulmonary diseases. Beyond inhalation therapy, NPs are a vibrant research area spanning medicine, electronics, materials science, and environmental applications. This article has highlighted key NP types such as LNPs, PNPs, MNPs, silica NPs, QDs, PBNPs, inorganic NPs, and EMNPs used in inhalation therapy. This ongoing research underscores the potential of NPs across various domains, reflecting their dynamic role in advancing scientific exploration and innovation. Several options for inhaled drug delivery are available today, but adapting these methods to nanoparticle therapy necessitates further research. Currently, nebulization devices are the most widely used for inhaled nanoparticle delivery, yet they present challenges due to their size and the labor-intensive handling required. Dry powder inhalers (DPIs) offer significant advantages over nebulization therapy and, for now, are preferred over pressurized metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs) due to their ease of use and improved patient compliance. Ongoing research efforts aim to enhance their capabilities and broaden their applications, particularly in respiratory medicine. 6. Challenges and Future Directions Achieving optimal particle size, surface loading efficiency, and reliable delivery sys- tems is pivotal to ensuring adequate NP concentration at targeted lung sites.

Long-term safety assessments and rigorous reg- ulatory approval processes are imperative, particularly for repeated administration in chronic conditions. To successfully transition NP-based inhalation treatments from laboratory devel- opment to clinical application, scalable and reproducible manufacturing techniques are essential. These efforts are crucial for realizing the full potential of inhaled NP-based therapies in respiratory medicine. Nanoparticles present exciting opportunities for personalized and gene therapy in conditions like cystic fibrosis. However, implementing nanoparticles in inhalation therapy involves challenges, particularly in incorporating gene therapy into DPIs or pMDIs. Over- coming technical barriers, such as ensuring particle stability, consistent dose delivery, and maintaining low internal resistance for patients with low inspiratory flows, is essential. These nanoparticles can be designed to target specific cells by integrating corrective genes into cellular DNA. Although these technologies hold revolutionary potential, they will likely provoke ethical debates regarding the extent of genetic manipulation. For these nanoparticles to be practically and widely used, it is crucial to fully un- derstand their interaction mechanisms within the respiratory tract and the pathogenic pathways affected by the released molecules.

This article is an open access publication ABSTRACT Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are heterogeneous airway dis- eases associated with signi\ufb01cant morbidity and mortality. Pharmacological treatment is deliv- ered primarily through the inhalation route using various devices. Optimal disease control is highly dependent upon patient adherence. Both patients with asthma and COPD are prone to exacerbations leading to hospitalization, which can signi\ufb01cantly impact quality of life. Poor adherence is a complex and multifactorial problem that does not have one simple solu- tion. However, it is the biggest risk factor for exacerbations and consequently high health- care utilization. This review discusses the com- plex and multifactorial obstacles that impact patient adherence as well as the effect on overall treatment outcomes and healthcare utilization. We also critically examined and compared rel- atively recent improvements in breath-activated pressurized metered dose inhalers, dry powder inhalers, and e-technology in asthma and COPD. Finally, future treatment strategies for better patient compliance such as personalized medicine and the importance of decision-mak- ing between patients and physicians were highlighted.

It is charac- terized by chronic airway in\ufb02ammation and increased bronchial hyerresponsiveness that can lead to a variety of symptoms typically seen in asthmatic patients such as cough, wheeze, chest tightness, and shortness of breath [2, 3]. These symptoms often occur after exposure to viral infections, exercise, cold air, allergens, strong smells, and a plethora of environmental irritants [4]. Patients have variable airway obstruction that is often reversible by using inhaled medication [5]. However, with pro- longed suboptimal treatment or no treatment at all, airway remodeling may begin to occur and Enhanced content To view enhanced content for this article go to http://www.medengine.com/Redeem/ CE98F06037576B69.

Once the diagnosis of asthma is con\ufb01rmed by spirometry, determining disease severity based on symptoms, nighttime awakening, and interference with normal activity aids in guid- ing initial treatment [6]. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) uses the Rules of Two\u0003 to differentiate patients who have intermittent asthma and persistent asthma [7]. Patients with intermittent asthma have symptoms less than 2 days a week, night- time awakening less than two nights a month, and require a short-acting b2-agonist (SABA) less than 2 days a week, have normal spirometry results between exacerbations, and have no disruptions in daily activities due to their asthma [6]. In contrast, patients with persistent asthma have symptoms much more frequently and are strati\ufb01ed into mild, moderate, and sev- ere asthma on the basis of frequency of symp- toms, nighttime awakenings, use of a SABA, lung function, and interference with daily activities [6]. On the basis of NAEPP\u2019s classi\ufb01cation, those with intermittent asthma only require a SABA without any regular maintenance treatment; however, there is emerging evidence towards regular inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) use as it reduces decline in lung function and asthma-related hospitalizations [6, 8, 9]. Fig- ure 1 summarizes a stepwise approach for the treatment of asthma. Should asthma control not be achieved with a certain level of treat- ment, inhaler technique, patient adherence, environmental triggers, and patient comorbidi- ties (e.g., allergic rhinitis) should be explored as possible contributing factors. Patients with persistent symptoms and exacerbations, despite correct inhaler technique and good treatment adherence, should be referred to a speciali", "tient comorbidi- ties (e.g., allergic rhinitis) should be explored as possible contributing factors. Patients with persistent symptoms and exacerbations, despite correct inhaler technique and good treatment adherence, should be referred to a specialist who has experience in dealing with this patient population [4]. At this point, other options such as tiotropium (a long-acting antimuscarinic), oral corticosteroids, and omalizumab (anti-im- munoglobulin E) may be considered [4, 6, 10]. Asthma severity is not static in nature and should be reassessed once the patient has been on maintenance medication for 3\u20134 months [6]. As with any disease state, it is important to \ufb01nd the minimum effective level of treatment offering the least amount of side effects to the patient. As such, if a patient has stable lung function and well-controlled symptoms for at least 3 months with no major risk factors for exacerbations, Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) advocates stepping down treatment [4]. Treatment goals of asthma include preventing mortality due to asthma, improving quality of life by allowing for maintenance of normal activities (school, work, exercise, etc.), reducing daytime and nighttime symptoms of cough, wheeze, and shortness of breath, preventing acute asthma exacerbations, and providing Fig. 1 Stepwise approach to treatment of asthma.

This article is based on previously conducted studies and does not involve any new studies of human or animal subjects performed by any of the authors. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is also a common airway disease affecting 210 million adults globally and is a cause of signif- icant morbidity and mortality [5]. It is a pro- gressive disease that results in air\ufb02ow limitation due persistent in\ufb02ammation in the airways, mucociliary dysfunction, lung hyperin\ufb02ation, and destruction of the lung parenchyma [11, 12]. Although long-term exposure to inhaled irritants, such as cigarette smoke, is the most common cause of COPD, breathing in chemical fumes, air pollution, alpha-1 antit- rypsin de\ufb01ciency, and persistent untreated asthma can also lead to the development of this disease [13]. The impact of COPD on a patient\u2019s quality of life is dependent on exercise capacity, comorbidities, and the severity of symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, phlegm production, and chest tightness [5, 12]. Additionally, COPD is associated with systemic or extrapulmonary effects such as right heart failure, skeletal mus- cle dysfunction, osteoporosis, and weight loss [11]. The goal of treatment is to reduce symp- toms, improve exercise tolerance, improve quality of life, prevent exacerbations, and reduce mortality [12]. One of the biggest differences between asthma and COPD is that airway obstruction is not fully reversible after using a bronchodilator [5]. An FEV1/FVC ratio of less than 0.7 after using a bronchodilator is one of the diagnostic criteria for COPD [14]. FEV1 by itself does not correlate well with patient symptoms, impair- ment, disability, and risk of mortality and should not be used as the sol", "1/FVC ratio of less than 0.7 after using a bronchodilator is one of the diagnostic criteria for COPD [14]. FEV1 by itself does not correlate well with patient symptoms, impair- ment, disability, and risk of mortality and should not be used as the sole manner of cate- gorizing severity and guiding therapy [12, 14]. Unfortunately, to obtain drug coverage for long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) and other inhalers in certain provinces in Canada, severity is primarily based on FEV1 by the gov- ernment drug plan. FEV1 C 80% predicted, 50% B FEV1\\80% predicted, 30% B FEV1\\ 50% predicted, and FEV1\\30% predicted are considered to be mild, moderate, severe, and very severe lung impairment, respectively [1, 14]. The modi\ufb01ed Medical Research Counsel dyspnea scale (mMRC), the COPD assessment test (CATTM), and the BODE index are a few of many grading systems that exist for COPD severity categorization, with no consensus on which system is superior [12, 14]. Maintaining optimal bronchodilation is important to improve patient symptoms as well as reduce mortality [15]. In addition to phar- macotherapy, which is summarized in Fig. 2, smoking cessation initiated early in the disease can slow disease progression and improve symptoms [14]. There is sparse evidence on whether a LAMA or LABA is superior when a long-acting agent is required; however, there is some data indicating that the LAMA tiotropium may be associated with a greater reduction in exacerbations and hospitalizations compared with the LABA salmeterol [12, 16]. If COPD is severe with frequent exacerbations, an ICS may be added; however, use of an ICS has been found to increase the risk of pneumonia [17]. If inadequate symptom relief and reduction in exacerbations are observed despite combination pharmacotherapy with correc", "e with frequent exacerbations, an ICS may be added; however, use of an ICS has been found to increase the risk of pneumonia [17]. If inadequate symptom relief and reduction in exacerbations are observed despite combination pharmacotherapy with correct inhaler tech- nique, ro\ufb02umilast, a phosphodiesterase-4 inhi- bitor, and/or adding the antibiotic azithromycin may be considered by a specialist [12, 14]. ADHERENCE AND CONSEQUENCES FOR PATIENTS\u2019 ASTHMA AND COPD Factors that Impact Patient Adherence For inhaled medications to deposit in the air- ways and be effective, patients must use them regularly with the correct technique [18]. This is especially important to reduce the likelihood of negative outcomes in asthma and COPD including poorer quality of life, reduced pro- ductivity, increased hospitalization, worsening of disease, and increase in mortality risk Pulm Ther (2017) 3:267\u2013281 269", "[1, 4, 12]. Medication adherence is de\ufb01ned as how closely a patient follows the recommended treatment plan mutually agreed upon with their health care provider [19]. Nonadherence can be either intentional or unintentional with inten- tional nonadherence involving patients actively choosing not to follow treatment prescribed for a variety of reasons [19]. Unintentional nonad- herence often involves patients wanting to use the treatment prescribed, but either do not use it at all, or deviate from the directions given as a result of misunderstanding instructions, for- getfulness, lack of affordability, and poor inha- ler technique [20]. The term adherence is preferred over the term compliance, as compli- ance implies the patient is to follow the rec- ommendation of their healthcare provider(s) without question, which goes against the movement towards patient-centered healthcare. Nonadherence, both intentional and unintentional, is important to frequently assess as it can not only change during the treatment course but can also be mistakenly labeled as refractory illness [20]. It is estimated that medication adherence rates for patients with asthma and COPD are less than 50%, which is quite low considering both the patient and economic consequences of poor disease control [21\u201323]. Nonadherence in COPD and asthma includes patients not initi- ating inhaler treatment, using less than pre- scribed, using more medication than prescribed, using the inhaler device in an inappropriate manner, and stopping treatment prematurely [19]. To devise individualized plans to tackle this problem, it is important to recognize that the reasons driving patient nonadherence are often multifactorial. Reasons for poor adherence, as seen in Table 1, can be broadly categorized into patient-, healthc", "devise individualized plans to tackle this problem, it is important to recognize that the reasons driving patient nonadherence are often multifactorial. Reasons for poor adherence, as seen in Table 1, can be broadly categorized into patient-, healthcare provider-, and healthcare system-related factors [24]. A patient-related factor may include having a lack of understanding of the disease itself and the progression and consequences of not using any form of treatment [24]. It is dif\ufb01cult to be adherent to any form of treatment for any chronic disease if a person does not understand why they were prescribed the medication in the \ufb01rst place, particularly if the bene\ufb01ts of treat- ment are not immediately apparent. An exam- ple of this is the use of ICS as maintenance treatment in asthma, where it takes weeks to months to have a noticeable bene\ufb01t [4]. In contrast, a SABA provides immediate relief of symptoms and its use can easily be justi\ufb01ed by a patient. Other patient factors include age, low socioeconomic status, lack of transportation to the pharmacy, personal beliefs and fears around using medications, patient comorbidities, cog- nitive and functional impairment, and family support [25]. Healthcare provider factors that can signi\ufb01cantly impact patient adherence include prescribing complex medication regi- mens, not considering affordability of medica- tions, lack of counseling on the disease as well as the risk versus bene\ufb01t of treatment, not thoroughly demonstrating inhaler technique, and overall ineffective communication between provider and patient [24, 25]. Although both patient factors and healthcare provider factors are important to address, issues with the healthcare system itself, which is beyond the control of the individual, can create barriers [24].

Although both patient factors and healthcare provider factors are important to address, issues with the healthcare system itself, which is beyond the control of the individual, can create barriers [24]. Healthcare system factors include high drug costs, poor communication between spe- cialists, hospitals, and primary care physicians, Fig. 2 SABA short-acting b2-agonist, SAMA short-acting antimuscarinic antagonist, LABA long-acting b2-agonist, LAMA short acting antimuscarinic antagonist, ICS inhaled corticosteroid 270 Pulm Ther (2017) 3:267\u2013281", "high patient load on family physicians, patient lack of access to a family physician, and lack of time for a clinician to properly counsel and assess patient adherence [24]. Effect of Patient Adherence on Treatment Outcomes and Healthcare Utilization Adherence with prescribed therapy is generally associated with better symptom control and improvement in lung function in asthmatics [22]. However, nonadherence can lead to poor disease control, which, if not recognized as the reason for symptoms, can be mistakenly diag- nosed as refractory illness and lead to inappro- priately escalating medication doses and addition/changes in therapy [20]. Additionally, both asthma and COPD symptoms can have a signi\ufb01cant impact on school, work, physical activities, and social life [1]. There is a clear trend of increased hospitalizations, mortality, loss of productivity as well as overall poorer quality of life in nonadherent patients [26]. Using disability-adjusted life years, the World Health Organization (WHO) ranks COPD 10th and asthma 22nd in terms of diseases causing the greatest burden globally [1]. Amongst chronic diseases, COPD is the \ufb01fth leading cause of death, with treatment found to signi\ufb01cantly reduce mortality [1]. Both the direct and indirect economic costs of asthma and COPD are quite considerable [22]. Direct costs include hospitalization, nurs- ing care, physician services, and prescription costs [27]. Indirect costs include poorer work performance, missed days of work, lost wages, employer costs, lost wages of caregivers, and disability [27]. In Canada, approximately 70,000 emergency department visits a year are due to asthma with the direct and indirect costs being greater than CAD $2.1 billion [28]. In the USA, total annual costs of COPD are estimated to be $52.4 bi", "and disability [27]. In Canada, approximately 70,000 emergency department visits a year are due to asthma with the direct and indirect costs being greater than CAD $2.1 billion [28]. In the USA, total annual costs of COPD are estimated to be $52.4 billion, with hospitalizations com- prising the bulk of this [12]. Exacerbations leading to hospitalization or emergency department use are the main source of health- care costs [22]. Therefore, appropriate persistent treatment as well as good patient adherence is expected to reduce these costs as they are asso- ciated with decreased exacerbations. RECENT IMPROVEMENT IN INHALER DEVELOPMENT Inhalation devices used in asthma and COPD include nebulizers, pressurized metered dose inhalers (pMDIs), soft-mist inhalers, and dry powder inhalers (DPI) [12]. The most important factors that determine drug deposition by Table 1 Factors that can impact patient adherence Patient factors Health care provider factors Health care system factors Age Socioeconomic status Transportation Fear of medication Values and beliefs Comorbidities Cognitive function Poor understanding of disease Family support Complicated treatments Disregarding medication price Patient education Inhaler technique Communication barriers Poor communication between specialist, hospital, and primary physician High physician patient load Lack of patient access to a family physician Lack of clinician time to properly counsel and assess patient Pulm Ther (2017) 3:267\u2013281 271", "inhalation are the inhaled particle size, aerosol velocity, and patient inspiratory \ufb02ow [29]. Par- ticle size is described as either mass mean aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) or \ufb01ne particle fraction (FPF) [18]. FPF is de\ufb01ned as the pro- portion of particles which are less than 5 mi- crons in diameter [18]. Drug particles greater than 5 microns are most likely to be deposited in the oropharynx, while particles between 2 and 5 microns have the greatest likelihood of being deposited throughout the bronchial tree [29]. Although pMDIs are one of the most widely used inhalation devices, they require adequate coordination between device actua- tion and inhalation as well as breathing slowly and deeply, which can be challenging for patients [29, 30]. It is not unusual for patients to actuate the device before inhaling, which leads to less drug deposition in the airways and hence a suboptimal clinical effect [31, 32]. To elimi- nate the coordination issue associated with pMDIs, research and development around breath-activated inhalers has greatly increased in the last decade [32]. Breath-activated inhalers can be in the form of a pMDI or a DPI. Breath-Activated Pressurized Metered Dose Inhalers Breath-activated pressurized metered dose inhalers (BA-pMDIs) contain the same pressur- ized canister as a pMDI, but instead of coordi- nating inhalation with actuation of the device, they contain a triggering mechanism which releases the dose after detecting a patient\u2019s inspiration [31, 33]. The Autohaler\u0003 and the Easi-Breathe\u0003 are the only two commercial BA-pMDIs that are available [18]. No such pro- duct exists on the Canadian market. The Auto- haler\u0003 requires inspiratory rates of 30 L/min while Easi-Breathe\u0003 requires rates of 20 L/min [18]. These inspiratory \ufb02ow rates are readily attaina", "commercial BA-pMDIs that are available [18]. No such pro- duct exists on the Canadian market. The Auto- haler\u0003 requires inspiratory rates of 30 L/min while Easi-Breathe\u0003 requires rates of 20 L/min [18]. These inspiratory \ufb02ow rates are readily attainable by most patients [32]. In contrast, traditional pMDIs require inspiratory rates between 30 and 60 L/min [33]. Both BA-pMDIs are believed to deliver an equivalent dose to the airways as a pMDI used with good technique [34]. However, in those who actuate a beclomethasone pMDI prior to inhaling, the mean drug deposition in the lung is 23% less than if using a BA-pMDI [35]. Other BA-MDIs that do not have any clinically used commercial products available include the K-Haler\u0003 and the MD Turbo\u0003 [36]. Dry Powder Inhalers Dry powder inhalers are all breath actuated and therefore do not have the issue of coordinating actuation and inhalation [18]. There has been a greater shift in research and development to DPIs partly due to their enhanced drug formu- lation stability, \ufb02exibility in inhaler design options, incorporation of hydrophobic drugs, and ability to achieve a high FPF [37, 38]. DPIs are categorized as either passive or active depending on whether they are dependent on patient inspiratory \ufb02ow [39]. For lung deposition to occur with passive inhalers, turbulent energy, which is formed as a product of patient inspiratory \ufb02ow as well as the DPI device\u2019s internal resistance, de-agglomer- ates drug particles to an appropriate size [18, 40]. The minimal turbulent energy required for particles to reach the optimal MMAD varies for each DPI device [18]. A higher inspiratory rate is expected to result in a higher rate of particle de-agglomeration [40]. The downside of this is that a higher inspiratory rate also results in increased d", "articles to reach the optimal MMAD varies for each DPI device [18]. A higher inspiratory rate is expected to result in a higher rate of particle de-agglomeration [40]. The downside of this is that a higher inspiratory rate also results in increased drug particle velocity, which is expected to lead to higher oropharyngeal drug deposition [41]. Additionally, a high inspiratory rate may be dif\ufb01cult to attain in children, elderly, and in certain patients with COPD and asthma [42]. A device with a generated peak inspiratory rate of 90, 60\u201390, 50\u201360, and less than 50 L/min is categorized as low, medium, medium\u2013high, and high resistance inhaler, respectively [18]. The intrinsic resistance refers to the inspiratory \ufb02ow rate required to produce a decrease in pressure of 4 kPa in the device [18]. There appear to be many misunderstandings in the literature regarding inspiratory \ufb02ow rates and inspiratory effort [43]. It is expected that patients using DPIs will exert maximal inspira- tory effort to generate a certain inspiratory air- \ufb02ow in the device [44]. This inspiratory air\ufb02ow will vary depending on the resistance of the 272 Pulm Ther (2017) 3:267\u2013281", "device. Therefore, to achieve the same inspira- tory \ufb02ow, patients using a high resistance inhaler would need to have a greater inspiratory effort than a low resistance device [44]. Unlike older devices on the market, DPIs approved in the past 5 years have shown FPF greater than 20% and require a lower inspiratory rate [45]. Four inhaler devices approved in the past 5 years include Genuair\u0003, Ellipta\u0003, Nexthaler\u0003, and Breezhaler\u0003 (Table 2). Genuair\u0003, which was approved by the FDA in 2012 for the treatment of COPD, is a multidose DPI with the long-acting antimuscarinic acli- dinium bromide [42]. Genuair\u0003 is also known as Novolizer\u0003 or Pressair\u0003 in different countries [46]. The device is relatively simple to use, requiring only the removal of the cap on the mouthpiece and a green button in the back to be pressed and released [38]. Successful inhala- tion of dose has occurred once the control window turns from the color green to red and an audible click is heard [38]. It was found in a randomized multicenter, crossover study that Genuair\u0003 had a greater overall patient prefer- ence and satisfaction compared to the Breez- haler\u0003 [47, 48]. Additionally, the number of patient attempts to result in a proper \ufb01rst inhalation was signi\ufb01cantly less than with the Breezehaler\u0003 [49]. The device offers an average FPF of 40%, a medium resistance with an aver- age inspiratory rate of 64 L/min for effective drug de-agglomeration [41, 43]. The mean per- centage of aclidinium bromide delivered in the airways and oropharynx of healthy adults was 30.1 \u00b1 7.3% and 54.7 \u00b1 7.2%, respectively [50]. The Ellipta\u0003 is also a multidose DPI that was FDA-approved in 2013 [42]. It contains the corticosteroid \ufb02uticasone furoate combined with the LABA vilanterol [42].

It contains the corticosteroid \ufb02uticasone furoate combined with the LABA vilanterol [42]. Unlike the Gen- uair\u0003, the Ellipta\u0003 device requires even fewer steps in that the patient is only required to open the mouthpiece cover fully, inhale the powder, and close the mouthpiece [51]. The Ellipta\u0003 device was found to have a 57% less incidence of handling errors with the \ufb01rst attempt com- pared to the Breezhaler\u0003 [52]. In a questionnaire given to 1050 patients, 94% responded that the device was easy or very easy to use [53]. Ellipta\u0003 is a medium resistance inhaler requiring an average inspiratory rate of 74 L/min [43]. How- ever, it has been reported that the delivered doses of both the ICS and LABA in the Ellipta\u0003 device are consistent over the \ufb02ow range of 30\u201390 L/min [54]. Even patients with severe COPD could generate suf\ufb01cient inspiratory \ufb02ows for consistent drug delivery [55]. The Nexthaler\u0003 is a multidose DPI contain- ing a combination of the LABA formoterol fumarate and the corticosteroid beclometha- sone dipropionate [32]. It was approved by the FDA in 2012 and is marketed as delivering extra-\ufb01ne powder for the treatment of asthma [42]. Approximately one-third of the FPF is comprised of particles smaller than 1 micron [56]. Although particles this small do not get deposited in the oropharynx, they are likely to enter the bronchial tree and be exhaled [56]. It was found that 56% of the inhaled dose from a Nexthaler\u0003 is delivered into the bronchial tree [57]. Additionally, the Nexthaler\u0003 device is sig- ni\ufb01cantly easier to use compared to the Tur- buhaler\u0003 and the Diskus\u0003 [58].

It has medium\u2013high resistance with inspiratory \ufb02ow rates of around 54 L/min [43]. The FPF is between 40% and 45%, which is considered quite high for a DPI [41]. Nexthaler\u0003 has consistent delivery of both drugs at \ufb02ow rates between 30 and 90 L/min [60] Unlike Genuair\u0003, Ellipta\u0003, and the Nex- thaler\u0003 devices, Breezhaler\u0003 is a single-dose DPI that requires the loading of a drug-containing capsule prior to each inhalation [32]. It is indi- cated for the treatment of COPD and contains the LABA indacaterol as well as the LAMA gly- copyrronium bromide [32]. It has been on the market longer than the other devices men- tioned, with many studies using it as a com- parator [47, 61]. The device requires the use of multiple steps and is associated with a greater number of errors [62]. It is characterized by a low intrinsic resistance with a minimum inspi- ratory \ufb02ow of 50 L/min and an optimal range of 90\u2013100 L/min [63, 64]. As a result of this devi- ce\u2019s low resistance, it is appropriate for patients of varying disease severity [65]. It offers a lower resistance than the Handihaler\u0003 as well as a 17% higher FPF and 14% lower oropharyngeal drug deposition [66, 67]. The quantity of active medication deposited in the airways with passive DPIs may have high patient variably due to differences in inspiratory \ufb02ow rate [40]. Active DPIs utilize an external energy source, independent of patient inspira- tory effort to de-agglomerate drug particles resulting in consistent drug delivery [39]. The InspiromaticTM (Inspiro Medical, Misgav, Israel), a new active DPI undergoing phase 1 and 2 clinical trials, utilizes drug-\ufb01lled capsules that are loaded into the device [68].

The InspiromaticTM (Inspiro Medical, Misgav, Israel), a new active DPI undergoing phase 1 and 2 clinical trials, utilizes drug-\ufb01lled capsules that are loaded into the device [68]. When the \ufb02ow sensor detects patient inspiration, which can be a \ufb02ow rate as low as 6 L/min, an active mechanism generates a pulsed vortexed \ufb02ow inside the capsule which is then inhaled by the patient [68]. The device provides audio and visual feedback when the dose has been deliv- ered completely and also records the time administered and overall patient inhaler per- formance in the memory chip; this data can then be downloaded and shared with the patient\u2019s primary healthcare provider. Formoterol, delivered by InspiromaticTM pro- duced a statistically greater improvement in FEV1 at 15, 30, and 60 min compared to the Aerolizer\u0003 [45, 68]. Another active DPI device that is still in development and has yet to undergo clinical trials is the Occoris\u0003 (Team Consulting, Cambridge, UK). Occoris\u0003 is an aerosolization engine that can be incorporated into various DPIs [45]. The company claims higher FPF and lower oropharyngeal drug deposition compared to typical passive DPIs [45]. E-TECHNOLOGY IN ASTHMA AND COPD The ability to use an inhaled device correctly plays a signi\ufb01cant role in ensuring effective therapy [69]. Correct inhaler technique in the form of written instructions is insuf\ufb01cient and should include a practical demonstration as well as reminders and follow-up [70]. E-tech- nology can provide a more consistent and standardized manner in educating patients about proper inhaler technique [71]. Addition- ally, these devices can provide key information to both physicians and patients to improve adherence [39]. This is important as 24% of asthma exacer", "nsistent and standardized manner in educating patients about proper inhaler technique [71]. Addition- ally, these devices can provide key information to both physicians and patients to improve adherence [39]. This is important as 24% of asthma exacerbations and 60% of asthma-re- lated hospitalizations are due to poor adherence [72]. Additionally, the use of e-technologies provides tools for patients to obtain general disease management education, self-monitor, obtain feedback, and identify trends and trig- gers [73]. Patient use of SABA was monitored in a study by Van Sickle et al. by attaching a device, known as Propeller, onto a pMDI [74]. The Propeller device, which is equipped with GPS, monitored the frequency, date, time, and location a SABA was used over 4 months. After the \ufb01rst month, patients began receiving weekly email reports of their SABA use. Interestingly, patients began having signi\ufb01cant decreases in daytime and nighttime symptoms as well as an increased awareness and understanding of asthma level of control, triggers, and asthma patterns [75]. The VeriHaler (Sagentia, Cambridge, UK) is a device that is currently in development for the 274 Pulm Ther (2017) 3:267\u2013281", "monitoring of inhaler adherence and perfor- mance [76]. The VeriHaler is a device compris- ing a microphone attached to the inhaler device casing. It is compatible with both pMDIs and DPIs. It utilizes an algorithm that removes unnecessary background noise and, on the basis of the acoustic signal detected, can sense the peak inspiratory \ufb02ow rate, timing of inhalation compared to actuation of dose, and delivery of the formulation through the device. Feedback on inhaler performance is then sent via Blue- tooth\u0003 on an iPhone app where the user and their physician can discuss ways to improve inhaler performance or switch devices alto- gether. Another device in development is the T-Haler which is an MDI training device with the ability to monitor inhaler shaking, time of actuation, and inhalation \ufb02ow [77]. It displays feedback to the user in the form of an interac- tive video game. FUTURE OF ASTHMA AND COPD TREATMENT Personalized Medicine In most asthma and COPD guidelines, treat- ment recommendations and algorithms usually follow a one size \ufb01ts all approach [78]. Patients who do not respond to the highest doses of medications, despite being adherent, are labeled as having refractory illness [79]. Both airway diseases are highly heterogeneous in nature and present with different characteristics [80]. Genetic variability may lead to different immunologic mechanisms and responsiveness to medications [81]. This is important as understanding the genetic variability and mechanisms involved in the disease formation and progression can pave the way to the development of new personalized and targeted therapies [82]. For example, IL-33 is thought to play a role in airway remodeling in asthma; however, ICSs, which are the mainstream of therapy, do not inhibit its action [82]. Severe a", "pave the way to the development of new personalized and targeted therapies [82]. For example, IL-33 is thought to play a role in airway remodeling in asthma; however, ICSs, which are the mainstream of therapy, do not inhibit its action [82]. Severe asthma may be divided into the Th2-high and Th2-low subtypes [83]. Patients with the Th2-high endotype are more likely to have increased airway hyerresponsiveness, high IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and airway eosinophilia that is responsive to ICS [84]. In contrast, patients with Th2-low asthma tend to not be responsive to ICS, despite high doses [79]. It is in these patients that the high corticosteroid doses pre- scribed were inappropriate. There is already some literature exploring testing techniques in an attempt to identify these patients and hence avoid unnecessary drug exposure [85]. Th2-low patients may have high neutrophil counts and may bene\ufb01t from a medication that reduces in\ufb02ammation due to this [83]. Future treat- ments may also target speci\ufb01c cytokines present in Th2-high asthma as well as attempt to understand the mechanism of Th2-low disease to develop more personalized therapies. In COPD, only select patients have an in\ufb02ammatory phenotype, hence wide usage of ICS may provide no bene\ufb01t with an increased risk of adverse effects [78]. After pooling ten randomized controlled trials, Pavord et al. found that there was a higher rate of pneumo- nia in patients with blood eosinophil counts less than 2% regardless of whether they were treated with an ICS or not [86]. Given the risks of acquiring a respiratory infection in those with severe COPD, future approaches may aim at avoiding unnecessary and prolonged use of ICS in patients with low eosinophil counts. Moreover, the cause and pathophysiologic pro- cesses that occur in a C", " of acquiring a respiratory infection in those with severe COPD, future approaches may aim at avoiding unnecessary and prolonged use of ICS in patients with low eosinophil counts. Moreover, the cause and pathophysiologic pro- cesses that occur in a COPD exacerbation are heterogeneous [87]. Identifying biomarkers to have a clearer diagnosis of the type of exacer- bation that occurred and how to prevent it could signi\ufb01cantly decrease morbidity. Shared Decision-Making Between Patients and Physicians Asthma and COPD are chronic diseases that require an ongoing patient\u2013physician relation- ship. Today\u2019s patients often desire a more active role in their healthcare as compared to the past [88]. Education around disease state, general approach to treatment, when to seek help, and action plans in the case of sudden worsening of symptoms enables patients to become more active in their care [12]. Patient participation in decision-making is known to lead to increased Pulm Ther (2017) 3:267\u2013281 275", "Table 3 Cost of some of the most common inhaler devices used in Canada Trade name Drug(s) Device type Doses per unit Drug class Cost per unit (CAD)a,b Ventolin\u0003 Salbutamol MDI 200 SABA 6.50 Ventolin\u0003 Salbutamol Diskus\u0003 60 SABA 12.56 Bricanyl\u0003 Terbutaline Turbuhaler\u0003 100 SABA 8.65 Atrovent\u0003 Ipratropium MDI 200 SAMA 21.15 Flovent\u0003 Fluticasone propionate MDI 120 ICS 26.39 (50 mcg) 45.51 (125 mcg) 91.03 (250 mcg) Flovent\u0003 Fluticasone propionate Diskus\u0003 60 ICS 26.39 (100 mcg) 45.53 (250 mcg) 69.66 (500 mcg) Pulmicort\u0003 Budesonide Turbuhaler\u0003 200 ICS 33.93 (100 mcg) 69.29 (200 mcg) 100.91(400 mcg) QVAR\u0003 Beclomethasone MDI 200 ICS 35.10 (50 mcg) 70.00 (100 mcg) Alvesco\u0003 Ciclesonide MDI 120 ICS 50.25 (100 mcg) 83.07 (200 mcg) Asmanex\u0003 Mometasone Twisthaler\u0003 120 ICS 69.29 (200 mcg) 100.91(400 mcg) Serevent\u0003 Salmeterol Diskus\u0003 60 LABA 63.73 Onbrez\u0003 Indacaterol Breezhaler\u0003 30 LABA 50.46 Advair\u0003 Salmeterol ? \ufb02uticasone propionate Diskus\u0003 60 LABA ?

As part of the decision-making process, it is important to consider that inhaler devices used to treat asthma and COPD can be very expen- sive, and affordability issues are one of the top reasons for poor patient adherence [90]. Addi- tionally, depending on the patient\u2019s \ufb01nancial situation, affordability of product(s) may be the main factor that drives patient preference [91]. The wholesale costs of the most common inhalers used for asthma and COPD patients are listed in Table 3 [92]. Patient beliefs and values are important to consider in chronic disease management as patients who are skeptical of medication and the overall healthcare system may have poorer outcomes despite agreement on appropriate therapy [93]. Moreover, what constitutes good adherence may vary depend- ing upon the patient\u2019s personal views and cul- ture [94]. Shared decision-making is a major component of patient-centered healthcare and involves participation of both patient and physician in all phases of care [95, 96]. A com- bination of evidence-based medicine and patient preference is more likely to lead to improvement in the health outcome the patient most values [97]. CONCLUSIONS Asthma and COPD are both chronic respiratory conditions that usually require long-term treatment. As with many chronic health con- ditions, asthmatics and COPD patients have a relatively low adherence rate. Several relatively new inhalers as well as electronic devices designed to improve patient adherence have become commercially available. With the vari- ety of medications and devices available, it is important for physicians to allow not only evi- dence-based medicine but also patient p", "ell as electronic devices designed to improve patient adherence have become commercially available.
