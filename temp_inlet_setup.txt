For drug delivery simulation, we need:
1. Inlet patch at trachea (region1) - drug particle entry
2. All other boundaries remain walls - particle deposition
3. No outlet - particles deposit on surfaces

This simulates:
- Inhaled drug particles entering through trachea
- Particles depositing on airway walls
- Realistic pharmaceutical inhalation therapy
